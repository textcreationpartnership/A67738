         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, thou muſt take notice that all Kingdoms and Common-wealths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Strength and Riches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are ſituated for Trade, and do convenience themſelves with juſt and equal Laws and Customs, whereby they out-do the reſt of their Neighbours. We ſee of late years what great Conteſts and bloody Wars have been betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and all to obtain the Mistreſs called <hi>Trade:</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants complaining how the <hi>Dutch</hi> out-trade them, and that they are not able to live. And ſo in proceſs of time they and others under pretence of aſcertaining the Merchants Rights blow up a War betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which hath ſeldom been compoſed with a Peace but the Merchant goeth by the worſt, and the People of <hi>England</hi> ſeldom bettered, or the Trade advanced. And it being my fortune to be travelling, and at <hi>Drayſden</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Court, when the
<pb facs="tcp:36927:10"/>ſad News came of the <hi>Dutch</hi> burning our Ships at <hi>Chattam,</hi> I made it then my buſineſs amongst other things I was employed in, to obſerve as far as I could how and which way the Trade of <hi>England</hi> might be improved and advanced. And when I had made my Obſervations of the Trade there, and how far it was to be taken notice of in order to the eſtabliſhing of the like in <hi>England,</hi> to ſet the Poor on work, which was the Linen, Thread, Tape, and Tin-plates, I came for <hi>Holland,</hi> being the time the Treaty was at <hi>Breda,</hi> where the Triple League was concluded, (<hi>viz.</hi>) between <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Swetheland.</hi> And there ſpending ſome time in the obſervations of their Laws, Cuſtoms, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Banks, Cut Rivers, Havens, Sands, Policies in Government and Trade, with their Natural Fortifications both by Sea and Land; weighing and conſidering all things, I was then ſatisfied we could not beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> with fighting. And by long ſtudying and weighing every part of their Condition, and alſo knowing ſome of our failings in the advance of Trade, and our weak Laws condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thereunto, I did ſee that all was out of joint; and purſuing the Cauſes thereof, in a ſmall time it appeared to me that although we could not beat them with fighting, yet on the other hand it
<pb facs="tcp:36927:10"/>was as clear to me that we might beat them without fighting; that being the best and juſteſt way to ſubdue our Enemies. My fancy growing higher and higher, and knowing it might be acceptable ſervice to the Publick Good of the Kingdom, I diſcourſed all parts and points now writ ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of times, with ſome Lords, ſome Judges, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Gentlemen, Merchants, Sea Officers, and Courtiers; and upon all that I could hear, and receiving all that could be ſaid againſt it, I was the more confirmed it might be done; upon which I was incouraged by many, and ſome of them Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, who offer'd me their aſſiſtance and help to make it ready for the Preſs, which I was preparing for. But before I could compleat my intentions I received a Letter from a Friend in <hi>Flanders,</hi> wherein he acquainted me that there would be Wars between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would be in great danger, and in proceſs of time <hi>Flanders</hi> alſo, and that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> would join against <hi>Holland:</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which I made a Map, and put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in two Squadrons at half Sea, and the <hi>French</hi> in one Squadron with them, and I put the <hi>Dutch</hi> in three Squadrons within their Sands and natural Holds, and did in the ſame Map underwrite the Reaſons
<pb facs="tcp:36927:11"/>here ſet down in this Treatiſe (why we might beat them without fighting) which Map was done three Weeks before the Breach was, which is ready to be produced, if by any deſired: And I did then at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and in many other places, ſhew by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the little fruits we might expect, and the great danger might enſue in breaking the Ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi> it being then ſo indifferently ſettled. But the Ballance being now broke, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Dutches</hi> preparations, (as to build Great Ships,) I am ſatisfied they aim at a larger Trade than ever, when opportunity offers it ſelf, and will endeavour to carry the Flag in the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Seas, and it's poſſible ſome where elſe, if not prevented by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Therefore theſe few Sheets are ſet abroad to ſhew the World how they may be Beat without Fighting; and by no other ways than the Free Lands of <hi>England</hi> being put under a Voluntary Regiſter by Act of Parliament: From the Credit whereof ſpring Banks, Lumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, with all Credits neceſſary to drive Trade, Cut Rivers, the Fiſhery, and all things elſe that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys are capable of; and it will drive away the great fears and complaints rooted in the hearts of the People, as the decay of Trade, the growing Power of the <hi>French,</hi> and much more.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The true way to beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> at Sea without Fighting.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> with Fighting is difficult, by reaſon of the great Advantages they have by their Sands and Holds all along the <hi>German</hi> Shore, from the Mouth of the <hi>Texel,</hi> and other <hi>Holland</hi> Rivers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mouth or Influx of the <hi>Elbe:</hi> And within theſe Sands and Holds they lye cloſe and ſafe as long as they pleaſe, and we cannot come at them with our Ships; the Reaſon is, we draw five Foot Water with our Ships more than the <hi>Dutch</hi> do with theirs; and we muſt lye beating at Sea, and receive all Storms and Accidents that the Seas and our Ships are lyable to, while
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36927:12"/>the <hi>Dutch</hi> are at Anchor within their defenſible Sands and Holds, and upon their own Coaſts, and there with eaſe may take in and be ſupplyed with all manner of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, Proviſion, and Men, with all other things they ſtand in want of. And when the wind blows ſtrong at Eaſt, we muſt bear away, and cannot keep our Station. The ſame wind that blows our Ships off, blows the <hi>Dutch</hi> out, and if they have a mind to follow us, they may; and when we are within ſome of our Bays they may come at us with eaſe: And as I ſaid before, the reaſon is, we draw five Foot Water more with our Ships, than the <hi>Dutch</hi> do with theirs: They build for their Shores and Harbours, and we build for ours; and we ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they make their Sea War only defenſive, and ſo will do untill they find themſelves ſtrong enough to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fight at half Sea. And what a comfort is it to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to ſee their Fleet lye, ſafe at Anchor near their own Shores, and their Enemies blown off by Storms and great Winds, and their Coaſts in two hours time free, clear, and ſafe from any Enemies? And when ſuch an Accident falls out, they may immediately put to Sea their ſeveral trading Fleets.</p>
               <p>Now that they have ſuch Natural defenſes by reaſon of their Holds and Sands, was very difficult to make Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of great parts and knowledge believe. But theſe Natural fortifications and (I may ſay) preſervations are not only the protection of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but of like benefit to all the People Inhabiting the <hi>German</hi> Shore, from the Mouth of the <hi>Texel</hi> and other <hi>Holland</hi> Rivers, unto the Mouth of the <hi>Elbe:</hi> And the <hi>Dutch</hi> may now and at all times by the help of theſe Sands and Holds ſail with their Smacks and ſmall Veſſels, of which they have great numbers, forth of the <hi>Texel</hi> clear along the <hi>Friezland</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36927:12"/>and <hi>Bremen</hi> Shore into the <hi>Emes, Weſer,</hi> and <hi>Elbe,</hi> to fetch in all manner of Proviſions for <hi>Holland,</hi> which may be had plentifully down the <hi>Emes, Weſer,</hi> and <hi>Elbe;</hi> and from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> all manner of Naval Stores, while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> muſt look on, and cannot poſſibly come at them.</p>
               <p>And if their Men of War are ſo ſecured by their Sands and Holds, and that the Smacks and ſmall Veſſels may creep Eaſtward by help of them, and fetch in Proviſions and Naval Stores uninterrupted; Then it is very clear and evident, they are not to be beat, War being made upon them, they acting their parts only defenſive.</p>
               <p>I could ſay ſomething of their Natural and Artificial fortifications in <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Friezland,</hi> having Surveyed many of their great Towns. For it is of great advantage to the Naval Power of <hi>Holland,</hi> that their three Maritime Provinces are ſo ſtrengthned by Art and Nature. And it is of like great advantage to the three Maritime Provinces that their Naval powers and force are ſo defenſively ſecured by the Sands and Holds upon theirs and the <hi>German</hi> Shores.</p>
               <p>I have ſeveral years in Publick in the hearing of ſome hundreds of Gentlemen given the ſame reaſons which now I here put in Print; And I have often heard many Gentlemen ſay and ſwear they might be fetched forth and deſtroyed, and ſuch diſcourſe was only by Perſons Dutchify'd; Some of which Perſons, as they ſince have told me, did intend to get me ſecured for ſetting but the ſtrength of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and ſpeaking of a <hi>Publick Regiſter,</hi> as they then thought, was ſpeaking againſt the Laws. But ſince thoſe Gentlemen are my Converts, and have preſſed me hard ſeveral times to know what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36927:13"/>applicable unto the <hi>German</hi> Shores than to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I promiſed them that it ſhould come forth in Print, for their and all other Gentlemens ſatisfaction; and I am ſure it is worth the knowing: And it is as neceſſary to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known by all Miniſters of State in <hi>Europe,</hi> as it is for them to know where the Ballance of <hi>Europe</hi> is beſt to be lodged for their Princes good. And I affirm that this ought by many Princes, who intend a Sea War, to be the firſt thing taken into conſideration. For whoſoever will make a Sea War muſt not promiſe himſelf ſucceſs againſt all Reaſon.</p>
               <p>In diſcovering to you the true Reaſons of theſe Sands and Holds, I muſt ſhew you the length of the Rivers of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> with the nature of the Land and Soyl the Rivers run through, with the advantage the Winds give in making theſe Holds and Sands; and how the Winds clear our Sands, and help to deepen our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Rivers.</p>
               <p>Moſt People think it very ſtrange, That in our three great Rivers in <hi>England,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Thames, Humber,</hi> and <hi>Severn,</hi> we ſhould have five Foot Water more at the Mouth or Influx than is at the Influx of the <hi>Texel, Rhine, Emes, Weſer,</hi> or <hi>Elbe,</hi> upon the <hi>German</hi> Coaſt; none of our Rivers running above one hundred and fifty Miles, and ſome of the <hi>German</hi> Rivers running one thouſand Miles; And it ſtands to Reaſon, the farther the Rivers run, and the more Water is in them, the deeper they ſhould be at the Influx.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt obſerve how the Winds blow, and how the Rivers lye to be Commanded by them. And ſecondly, you muſt conſider from whence the Rivers come, and whither they run, either through Clay, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly, or Sandy Lands. The Winds blow at South and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36927:13"/>Weſt two Thirds of the year, and theſe Winds are great and ſtrong, and have their Guſts and force upon the Mouths of the <hi>German</hi> Rivers; and when there are great Rains in <hi>Germany,</hi> and upon the Borders of <hi>Poland,</hi> where are great Sands, it brings them down into the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and ſo down to the Mouth or Influx therof; where often it meets with a South or Weſt Wind, and the Tide and Wind coming in both together, force the Sands into Beds, which by degrees increaſe to great Banks, and ſo alter the Channel, and in proceſs of time work them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by new Freſhes down the <hi>Elbe</hi> into the Sea, and then the Winds and Tide trouls them, and give them a ſettlement along the Shores. And the like it doth at the Mouth or Influx of all the great Rivers on the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Shores. And as long as the Winds blow, and the Rivers run as now they do, theſe Natural forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and preſervations by Sea ſhall be to the People inhabiting the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Coaſts.</p>
               <p>The true Reaſons now being made plain, I deſire the Reader to conſider (if this I have ſaid be true) which is more adviſeable; an hazardous War by Sea, or to bring to paſs the things that will beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> without fighting?</p>
               <p>The Reaſon wherefore the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Rivers draw five Foot Water more than the <hi>German</hi> Rivers do at the Mouth or Influx is, becauſe they run not above one hundred and fifty Miles, and through Clay, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly Land, which ſort of Soyl ſends but little quantity of Sand down into the great Freſhes. And our South and Weſt Winds being great, and blowing, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, two parts in three in the year at thoſe Points, force out the Sands, and ſend them into the Ocean; And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome certain Tides, force them over to help to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36927:14"/>the Holds on the <hi>German</hi> Shore. Obſerve but the Mouth of the River <hi>Dee</hi> that runs by <hi>Cheſter</hi> which lyes in the Face of the South and Weſt Winds, and there you will find the Winds and Tides have done the like; By which at this preſent a Veſſel of twenty Tuns can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come loaded to that Old Noble Town of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now it is time to begin to ſhew you how we may beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> without fighting? To beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> with fighting, ſo as to force them from their beloved Miſtriſs and delight, (which is Trade and Riches thereby) hath been the deſign of moſt of their Neighbours for this forty years laſt paſt, who thought thereby to bring that Miſtreſs of Trade to leave that People, and betake her ſelf to a place of better Ports, and healthfuller Air. To which purpoſe upon the end of War betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> many advantageous Articles have been agreed upon, and ſome good Laws made to encourage Trade and the Merchants: But I ſee although we get this Miſtreſſes Love, it is but for a ſhort time; ſhe is ſtill endeavouring to be gone, and ſeat her ſelf in that dull and flegmatick Air. And the Reaſons wherefore ſhe doth ſo, and will do ſo, I will here diſcover unto you.</p>
               <p>All Kingdoms and Common-wealths in the World that depend upon Trades, common <hi>Honeſty</hi> is as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and needful in them, as Diſcipline is in an Army, and where is want of common Honeſty in a Kingdom or Commonwealth, from thence Trade ſhall depart. For as the Honeſty of all Governments is, ſo ſhall be their <hi>Riches;</hi> And as their <hi>Honour, Honeſty,</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> are, ſo will be their <hi>Strength;</hi> And as their <hi>Honour, Honeſty, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> are, ſo will be their <hi>Trade.</hi> Theſe are five Siſters that go hand in hand, and muſt not be parted. All people that know any thing of <hi>Holland,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36927:14"/>know that the people there pay great Taxes, and eat dear, maintain many Souldiers both by Sea and Land; and in the three Maritime Provinces have neither good Water nor good Air: And that in ſome of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they pay Fifty years Purchaſe for their Lands, and are many times ſubject to be deſtroyed by the devouring waves of the Sea's overflowing their Banks. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe ſtrange, and unheard Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yet they will not quit their Station, and remove to places of more ſafety and leſs Taxes (though never ſo civilly treated.) The Reaſon whereof is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> They have fitted themſelves with a Publick Regiſter of all their Lands and Houſes, whereby it is made Ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys at all times, without the charge of Law, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Lawyer. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By making Cut Rivers Navigable in all places where Art can poſſibly effect it; thereby making Trade more Communicable and Eaſie than in other places. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By a Publick Bank, the great Sinews of Trade, the Credit thereof making Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per go in Trade equal with Ready Money, yea better in many parts of the World than Money. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Court of Merchants to end all differences betwixt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and Merchant. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A Lumber-houſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all poor people may have Moneys lent upon Goods at very eaſie Intereſt. As I have ſhewed you their Strength before, now in theſe five Particulars you may ſee their Policie, upon which lies all their Happineſs and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. By theſe Policies of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the want of our Lands being put under a Regiſter, One hundred pounds a year in <hi>Holland</hi> at this preſent time will raiſe a Family ſooner, and drive a better and more profitable Trade, than a man can do of a Thouſand pounds a year in <hi>England.</hi> But if we write by their Copies, we ſhall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36927:15"/>do the great things they now do, and I dare ſay out-do them too.</p>
               <p>Now I will demonſtrate to all men unbiaſſed the truth of what I aſſert, and ſhew them the Condition the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and People of <hi>England</hi> are in at this day; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Condition the <hi>Dutch</hi> are in at this day in all their Provinces. Let a Gentleman now in <hi>England</hi> that hath a Thouſand pounds a year Land, that owes Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, come to a Money Scrivener, and deſire Four thouſand pounds to be lent him on all his Land, and produce his Writings, and the Eſtate hath been in the Family Two hundred years; I know at this day the Anſwer will be, that by the Law of <hi>England</hi> as it is now practis'd, no man can know a Title by Writings, there being ſo many ways to incumber the Land privately: And therefore the Anſwer commonly is, Bring us Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the Covenants, and we will lend you the Moneys. The Gentleman gets ſuch Friends as he can procure to be bound for his Covenants, whom if they accept, then the Procurator and Continuator have their Game to play: But if he bring not ſuch Security as they like, he goeth without this Four thouſand pounds; which is a ſad and lamentable caſe, he having Lands worth a Thouſand pounds a year. And now he is put to his ſhifts, his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors come upon him, the charge of Law-ſuits comes on, all his Affairs are diſtracted, his Sons and Daughters want Money to ſet them into the World. At laſt it is poſſible he gets Two thouſand pounds a piece of two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, of one at <hi>York,</hi> and of the other at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and Mortgages all his Lands to each man: This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues private for ſome years: The while the Gentleman ſtrives what he can to be honeſt, and prepare Moneys to pay off one of the Mortgages: But it commonly falls
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36927:15"/>out otherwiſe, either through bad Times, or decay of Tenants, great Taxes, or the Eldeſt Son matching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Father's will, or oftentimes it is worſe, he is ſo debaucht no one will match with him: Now the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's miſeries come on, and what muſt he then do? for the perſons that have the Lands Mortgaged will not ſtay, becauſe by this time it is diſcover'd the Land is twice mortgaged. I tell you the Lawyers Harveſt is now come in, and the Eſtate torn to pieces, and the Gentleman, his Wife and Family, and it may be Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors too undone. For ſeeing all is in danger to be gone, the Friends of the Wife Trump up a former Title to the two Mortgages, and fence to get all the Eſtate that She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, Bayliffs, Sollicitors, and Lawyers leave, to be to the Uſes intended or pretended in the Private Settlement. But you will ask me, What the poor Gentleman ſhall do to ſecure his Perſon? I will tell you what ſome have done, and many more I know muſt do, even turn over either to the <hi>Fleet</hi> or <hi>Bench.</hi> O <hi>Pity,</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> that it ſhould be ſo in brave <hi>England! Firſt, Pity</hi> that a poor Gentleman cannot have Moneys at ſuch intereſt upon his Land, as the Law directs, to pay his juſt Debts, and for the good and comfort of his Family. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a <hi>Sin,</hi> that a Gentleman of a Thouſand pounds a year ſhould be the occaſion of ruining ſo many Families as he does, by putting them to ſuch vexatious Suits for their Moneys lent, and it may be at laſt loſe all.</p>
               <p>And that you may further ſee the badneſs of the Land Security at this day, take theſe two Accompts. In the Country where I live, I have been a Commiſſioner in the Third part of the greateſt Eſtates in the County, wherein I have ſeen the Settlements two ways, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them proved which are lying dormant, and ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36927:16"/>will do. The Civil Wars were the occaſion of theſe Settlements. And in the next County an Attorney (<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Phillpot</hi> of <hi>Hereford</hi>) about four years ſince put out in print two Sheets, to ſhew Reaſons wherefore a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Lands is needful: And amongſt the reſt, this is one: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the County where I live, I know men that have deceived, and are deceived, to the value of Forty thouſand pounds, beſides what all others know.</hi> And whoever perfectly knows that Country will ſay, none in <hi>England</hi> out-does it as to benefit the life of man: But Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Honeſty being decayed, Riches will not ſtay. I am ſorry I muſt make ſuch a Diſcovery of the badneſs and uncertainty of Titles, but if the wound be not ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bottom, there will be no hope of a Cure.</p>
               <p>In this poſture as you ſee are many poor men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which cannot borrow Four thouſand pounds of a Thouſand pounds a year Land. I pray let us ſee what a poſture a <hi>Dutchman</hi> ſtands in, that hath One hundred pounds a year, and wants Four thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>Now I am a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and have One hundred pounds a year in the Province of <hi>Weſt-Friezland</hi> near <hi>Groningen,</hi> and I come to the Bank at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and there tender a Particular of my Lands, and how tenanted, being One hundred pounds a year in <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> and deſire them to lend me Four thouſand pounds, and I will Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my Land for it. The Anſwer will be, I will ſend by the Poſt to the Regiſter of <hi>Groningen</hi> your Particular, and at the return of the Poſt you ſhall have your Anſwer. The Regiſter of <hi>Groningen</hi> ſends Anſwer, It is my Land and tenanted according to the Particular. There is no more words, but tell out your Moneys. OBSERVE all you that read this, and tell to your Children this ſtrange thing, <hi>That Paper in</hi> Holland <hi>is equal with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36927:16"/>in</hi> England. I refuſe the Moneys, I tell him I do not want Moneys, I want credit, and having one Son at <hi>Venice,</hi> one at <hi>Newemberge,</hi> one at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and one at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> where Banks are, I deſire four Tickets of Credit, each of them for a Thouſand pounds, with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Advice directed to each of my Sons, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately done, and I Mortgage my Lands at Three in the Hundred. Reader, I pray Obſerve, that every Acre of Land in the Seven Provinces trades all the world over, and it is as good as ready Money; but in <hi>England</hi> a poor Gentleman cannot take up Four thouſand pounds upon his Land at ſix in the hundred Intereſt, although he would Mortgage a Thouſand pounds a year for it. No and many Gentlemen at this day of Five hundred pounds a year in Land, cannot have credit to live at a Twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny Ordinary. If this be ſo, it is very clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that a man with One hundred pounds a year in <hi>Holland</hi> ſo convenienced as their Titles are, and at the paying but three in the Hundred Intereſt for the Moneys lent, may ſooner raiſe Three Families, than a Gentleman in <hi>England</hi> can either raiſe One, or preſerve the Family in being, for the Reaſons already given. But were the Free Lands of <hi>England</hi> under a voluntary Regiſter, all theſe Miſeries would vaniſh, and the Lands would come to Thirty years Purchaſe, which I ſhall ſhew you in its proper place.</p>
               <p>But I know you would underſtand the Reaſon, why a <hi>West-Friezland</hi> man may have Four thouſand pounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Hundred pounds a year?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Becauſe there the Land is worth Fifty years Purchaſe. And after the Four thouſand pounds is lent, the Party that owns the Land may, if he pleaſe, at the ſmaller Bank at <hi>Groningen</hi> take up Six hundred pounds
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36927:17"/>more in Bank Dollers, upon the ſame Hundred pounds a year: For Credit is given to the value of the Land within Two years Purchaſe of what the Land goeth at.</p>
               <p>I can both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> Regiſter my Wedding, my Burial, and my Chriſtening, and a poor Pariſh Clerk is intruſted with the keeping of the Book; and that which is Regiſter'd there, is good by our Law: But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Regiſter my Lands to be honeſt to pay every man his own, to prevent thoſe ſad things that attend Families for want thereof, and to have the great benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that would come thereby. A Regiſter will quicken Trade, and the Land Regiſtred will be equal as Caſh in a mans hands, and the Credit thereof will go and do in Trade what Ready Moneys now doth. Obſerve how it advanceth Trade in <hi>Holland,</hi> and of how little Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it is to the Trade of <hi>England.</hi> I having One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a year in <hi>Holland,</hi> meet with a Merchant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Exchange</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and agree with him for Goods to the value of Four thouſand pounds for ſix Months: If he demands Security, I go to the Bank, and give him Security by a Ticket of my Land, and by the Credit of that Ticket the Merchant is immediately in Trade again as high as the Commodity was he ſold. But if I make a Bargain at <hi>London</hi> for Four thouſand pounds worth of Goods for ſix Months, the next diſcourſe is, What Security? Then the Buyer and the Seller agree to meet at the Tavern at Four of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: There the Buyer produceth his Security, many times not approved of; ſo the Merchant cannot put off his Commodities, nor the Chapman have the Goods he ſtands in need of. But if the Buyer or any Friend of his, that would Credit him, had Land under a Regiſter, then a Ticket upon ſuch Lands given to the Merchant would
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36927:17"/>be equal to him as Ready Moneys; and I ſay better too.</p>
               <p>It is the common miſtake of the world who cry up the <hi>Dutch</hi> for a great Caſh in Bank, it is not ſo, it is a great miſtake; For it is a Bank of Credit, and Paper is in that Bank equal with Moneys, the Anchorage, Fund and Foundation being laid Safe: And that is the Lands being under a Regiſter, from whence iſſue theſe delightful Golden Streams of Banks, Lumber-houſes, Honour, Honeſty, Riches, Strength and Trade. You may read in Sir <hi>William Temples</hi> Book of his Obſervations of the <hi>Nether-lands</hi> this Expreſſion:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the States ſend to Perſons who have lent them Moneys to come and receive their Moneys and Intereſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they come with Tears in their Eyes deſiring them to continue it longer:</hi> And the Reaſon is, they know the Security is good. And when ever they give Notice they will take up a Sum of Moneys, there is great ſtriving who can get in his firſt.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, I talk that Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> cannot have Moneys for Land; It is not ſo: And that I ſay Lawyers know no Titles, I ought to have my pate crackt; for money is plentiful, and Lawyers are cunning enough to ſpy out good Titles.</p>
               <p>As to both I would it were true, for the ſake of the poor Gentlemen, and the Lawyers too. But as to the greateſt part of them, that have Thouſand pounds a year, the World knows they are ſo far from borrowing Four thouſand pounds, that they cannot borrow Four hundred pounds; and I dare ſay ſome Lords alſo.</p>
               <p>Nay, to my knowledge three eminent Lawyers have been put to much charge and trouble, in their Eſtates lately purchaſed by them, in <hi>Montgomery, Hereford,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36927:18"/>
                  <hi>Worceſter</hi> Shires, by reaſon of former Incumbrances. Now if an Eminent Lawyer cannot purchaſe an Eſtate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much trouble, hazard, and charge, upon a Title ſettled at leaſt fifty years ago by all the Judges of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in the Exchequer-Chamber; upon what Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can the Bankers be underſtood to lay out their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſafe? And the poor Country-men are yet in a worſe condition.</p>
               <p>I will now ſhoot a Granado into <hi>London,</hi> not to fire them, but I hope 'twill make them look about them, and enquire after the Engineer, and demand how ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter can be made, and do good and no harm, and how it may be fixt, ſo that <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts may both preſerve and encreaſe their Credit. I will now ſhew you the Condition of <hi>London,</hi> as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſtands, and how it would have been, if the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes new built had been by Law to be Regiſterd at <hi>Guild-Hall.</hi> Admit the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern in <hi>Fleet Street</hi> were mine, and Set at One hundred pounds a year, and I owe ſix hundred pounds, and go to the Scriveners and deſire them to lend me ſix hundred pounds upon the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern. I Shew them the Purchaſe of the Ground Rent, the Patent from the Judges taken in, and all other Titles bought. I preſume I cannot have the Six hundred pounds upon my houſe, but I muſt give great Security for my Covenants. I preſent ſuch Security as I can get, which will not be accepted. Now for want of this ſix hundred pounds, on a ſudden to pay my Debts, I am undone, Wife, Children and many more whom I owed moneys to, my Goods ſeized, my Houſe taken from me, and it's poſſible a Priſon too, or a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Bankrupt taken out, to the Ruine of all. But if it had been foreſeen when the Act paſt for the building
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36927:18"/>the City, that there had been put into the Bill theſe few Lines, <hi>Be it Enacted by the Kings moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majeſty.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That all Houſes which ſhall hereafter be new built in and near the City of</hi> London, <hi>deſtroyed by the late dreadful Fire, may (if they pleaſe) he Regiſtred by the Owners at the</hi> Guild-Hall <hi>within the City of</hi> London; <hi>And all ſuch Houſes ſo Regiſtred, ſhall be a good Title to the Party Regiſtring ſuch Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſhall Barre all perſons whatſoever, The King not Excepted; Provided there be no Claym entred within ſix Months next after the Regiſtring of ſuch Houſe and Houſes; And ſuch Clayms as are entred ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded upon in the ſaid City, and no where elſe, in due form as the Law directs.</hi> And if this had been done, I then go to any Scrivener that deals that way, and deſire to borrow a Thouſand pounds on the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> being Rented at One hundred pounds a year; there will be then no more to be done, but their Servant is ſent to the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> to ſee whoſe the <hi>Green Dragon</hi> Tavern is, and he brings word it is mine; There is no more ado, I ſay, but the Thouſand pounds is told out, and I give Security for it by a Mortgage put into the Regiſter of my Houſe. Then I go and pay my Debts, prevent Law-ſuits, preſerve my ſelf, Wife, Children, and Reputation, and all is well: And that which is beſt of all, the Party lending the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys is ſafe, well and ſurely ſecured. It is poſſible great part of the Thouſand pounds lent might be the Moneys of poor Widows and Orphans, here are both to the Lender and borrower great Advantages; To the one there is undeniable Security, and to the other preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36927:19"/>upon all occaſions. The wanting whereof hath been the ruine of ſome thouſand Families ſince the firing of <hi>London.</hi> And this is that which will encreaſe and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Trade; and the Houſes Regiſtred will be equal with ready Moneys at all times, according to the value of the Houſes. And if this we treat on had been done, there needed not one Houſe to ſtand empty and untenanted, as now they do; nor the Trade to depart out of the City, as it hath done ſince the Fire. I deſire and heartily wiſh that the Governours of the City would prepare a Bill againſt the next Sitting of Parliament to put the new Buildings under a Regiſter. I will not Propheſie that a Bank ſhall riſe in <hi>London</hi> equal with that of <hi>Amſterdam, London</hi> being put under a voluntary Regiſter; but I will make it out, when ever the Heads of the City pleaſe to deſire it, That if <hi>London,</hi> with the Free Lands of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex, Eſſex, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Surrey</hi> were under a voluntary Regiſter; two of the Ridings of <hi>Yorkſhire, Lincolneſhire, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi> were under another voluntary Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; <hi>Gloceſterſhire, Somerſetſhire,</hi> and <hi>Monmouthſhire</hi> under another voluntary Regiſter; and <hi>Devonſhire</hi> under another; then there would be as great a Bank at <hi>London</hi> as at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and would be able to do much more in Trade, Credit, and all great things, than they can; and as great a Bank at <hi>Briſtol</hi> as at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and would be able to drive as great a Trade, and ſet up the neglected, and I may ſay decayed Trade of Fiſhing upon the Coaſt of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and as great Banks at the two Towns of <hi>Lynne</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and at <hi>Hull</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and drive as good a Trade as at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and enliven the Clothing Trade now brought very low, and ſet on foot that great and deſirable Rich Trade of Fiſhing on their Coaſts, which ſo advantageouſly offers it ſelf. (O yes,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36927:19"/>O yes, O yes, what is become of the Moneys given vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily for the ſetting forward this good work of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about twelve years ſince? If any one will help me to the twenty ſhillings I gave, I will give him nineteen for his pains.) And as great a Bank at <hi>Exeter</hi> as at <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberge,</hi> and give life and ſtrength to the great Wollen Manufacture in all the Weſt of <hi>England.</hi> For no great things can be done without a Bank, and no Bank can be of any benefit to Trade, and the Publick, but where there is a Regiſter.</p>
               <p>And I would have the miſtaken world know, that a Bank is as ſafe and practicable in a Kingdom, as in a Common-wealth, and particularly in an Iſland that is convenient for Trade. And the Reaſon why it is ſo, is, becauſe it is a Bank of Credit, not of Caſh, as is the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, whoſe Treaſures are abroad in Trade and increaſing, and only the Books in the Offices. I ſay it is impoſſible to keep a Bank from riſing in this Kingdom, nay many Banks, if we were under a voluntary Regiſter. But now the Land Credit and the City Bank Credit are both diſparaged; therefore it is impoſſible that Trade can any way be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured or bettered. And for perſons behind-hand and in debt they muſt expect miſery.</p>
               <p>Of late years the monied Men in <hi>England</hi> ſent their Moneys into <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> and there received a Note from a Goldſmiths Boy, which was all they had to ſhew for their Moneys. And certainly there was a Reaſon wherefore the great monied men did take ſuch ſlender Security for their Moneys; The Reaſon was, becauſe the Land Security was ſo uncertain and bad, and it was ſo troubleſome and chargeable getting their Moneys again when they had occaſion to uſe it, that forc't them
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36927:20"/>to <hi>Lombard-ſtreet.</hi> For two parts in three that put their Moneys into theſe uncertain <hi>Banks,</hi> know better how to lay their Moneys out in Land Security, than any of the banking Goldſmiths or Merchants either. But the Land Security being not good, the Moneys tumbled into the wrong Channel. And all perſons that have deſigns to get conſiderable Sums of Moneys into their hands for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended deſigns, or hazardous adventures, apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Money-Bankers, and there make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches by noble Treats, great Offers, with large Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, with Country Baronets, Knights, Eſquires, and it's poſſible ſome Citizens alſo for Security; and at laſt creep into the credit of borrowing great Sums of Money upon Land Mortgaged twice or thrice before, for in the Country none could be borrowed. At length the <hi>Banker</hi> calls for his Moneys, but none can be paid. The <hi>Banker</hi> dares not adventure to ſue; but all that he dare do, is to employ a Lawyer only to whiſper (not to make a noiſe) or give him ſome private Duns; for if he ſues or falls on, that would cauſe the perſon that credited the <hi>Banker</hi> to call in his Moneys, and ſo the <hi>Banker's</hi> Credit would be ſpoiled; therefore all is to be ſilent and huſh. The <hi>Banker</hi> by this time ſeeth and knoweth his condition, now he caſts about how to preſerve himſelf from the Storm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and it is poſſible ſome conſiderable Creditor by this time ſpies ſome bad Bargains made by the <hi>Banker,</hi> and calls in his Moneys: His earneſtneſs puts on others to do the like, and then all his Creditors crowd to him as Pigs do through a hole to a Bean and Peaſe Rick. Now the <hi>Banker</hi> ſtands upon his guard, ſpeaks fair to ſome, prevails with others to have patience a while; and in the mean time he adviſes not his Creditors, but his own intereſt. Now by the importunity of his Wife and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36927:20"/>Friends, he ſecures perhaps Two or Three Thouſand pounds free from all Peoples approaches. Then you ſhall have him make Offers, and prays Time, proffers his Books to be ſurveyed, and ſaith that he will be juſt, and hath husbanded the Moneys with juſtice and honeſty. The Books are preſented, the major part of the Creditors proclaim that there is Eſtate ſufficient to pay all. So the minor Creditors muſt be concluded. And then Time is given to pay by degrees, and Bond is given for the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But by whom? Even by the <hi>Bankers</hi> themſelves. A brave Security! but if their Books were ſurveyed by Perſons that know Men, and the Securities that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is not to be queſtioned but Sir <hi>Foplin Flutter</hi> and Eſquire <hi>Nipp</hi> have good part of the Moneys upon the Mortgages of Lands, Mannors, and Tenements, and great part as eaſie to be recovered as it is to bring <hi>Penmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor</hi> and <hi>Gore Agoluath</hi> together, being the two great Mountains in North <hi>Wales.</hi> And it is poſſible that great part of thoſe Moneys are ventured to Sea by Merchants; and rather than their Friend the Goldſmith ſhall ſuffer, he ſhall ſhut up Shop and go to Sea with his Merchant, and bring home the ſuppoſed loſt Eſtate, and at his return pay God knows what.</p>
               <p>It is probable that any man that ſends his Moneys into any of theſe <hi>Banks</hi> will conclude it impoſſible to employ ſo great Caſh, as they are intruſted with, any other way than by lending upon Land Security, or to Merchants to venture to Sea, or to Citizens and others upon Perſonal Security. And if the Caſh can be employed no other way, then the Lender muſt conclude the <hi>Banker</hi> is not able to ſecure the Moneys, but muſt run the hazard of bad Security by Land, and ſuch hazards at Sea as attend Merchants, with the badneſs and uncertainty of Perſonal
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36927:21"/>Security. And it is not to be imagin'd there being ſuch great Caſh put into the <hi>Bankers</hi> hands, that they ſhould ſtand to the loſs of all moneys miſventur'd by truſting and bad Securities: And it muſt be madneſs for the <hi>Bankers</hi> to keep the moneys in their Cheſts by them, unleſs they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to keep part for themſelves, and pay part, and then lay the Key under the Door. I beg this one queſtion of ſuch Country Gentlemen as have put their moneys into the <hi>Bankers</hi> hands, Whether they do not know better how to lay out their moneys on Land Security than the <hi>Bankers</hi> do? Yes I know they do ten to one better; for they partly know Titles that may be indifferent certain, and know the Reputations of the Perſons better than the <hi>Bankers,</hi> as I have ſet down before. And if there can be no Security given to the <hi>Bankers</hi> more than I have ſet down, then in the name of God let them that have a mind to proceed further with them go on and proſper if they can.</p>
               <p>But it will be Objected, That I am no Friend to the way of Banking as now it is. I do profeſs it, and have been of the ſame mind this ten years laſt paſt; and have declared before ſome of the <hi>Bankers</hi> and many Perſons of Quality beſides, that this way of banking would endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Kingdom. And when I ſaw it convenient, which was in <hi>January</hi> laſt, I gave Reaſons in Publick Coffee-houſes for my Opinion, ſome of the <hi>Bankers</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Their way of Dealing I knew, and what Security they took, which was impoſſible ſhould run long. And as the Land and Perſonal Security is at this day, no living man, although never ſo knowing in the Laws or in Men, can take a great Caſh into his hands, and pay ſix in the hundred for it. Is it not a ſad thing, that a <hi>Banker's</hi> Boy ſhould take up more moneys upon his Notes in one day,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36927:21"/>than two Lords, four Knights, and eight Eſquires in twelves months upon all their Perſonal Securities? Unleſs we are cutting off our Legs and Arms to ſee who will feed the Trunk. We cannot expect this from any of our Neighbours abroad, whoſe intereſt depends upon our loſs. Were it not much better that thoſe Lords, Knights, and Eſquires that now pay eight, nine, and ten pounds in the Hundred for their moneys, and are contented to ſell their Lands at ſixteen years Purchaſe, after Law-ſuits and troubles attending the Law have deſtroyed the one half, ſhould bring up their Lands to thirty years Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and Moneys down to three and a half in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and redeem the old Credit paid by the People to them?</p>
               <p>And I muſt here beg the Gentlemens pardon that wear the Gold Chains in the City of <hi>London,</hi> if I Petition them to take into their Care the true intereſt of that Ancient Noble City, which is by uſing ſuch means as may bring it under a voluntary Regiſter, where a <hi>Bank</hi> will ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe, and ſuch a <hi>Bank</hi> as will be for the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the whole Kingdom, and Trade Univerſal.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe all the houſes in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet</hi> be put into a Regiſter, the title thereby ſafe and ſecure, let them be the Credit, Anchorage, Fund and Foundation to build your <hi>Bank</hi> upon. Then admit the houſes in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet</hi> are worth ten thouſand pounds a year, and valued at twenty years purchaſe, which they will go at, and much more; Then the <hi>Bank</hi> credit that is to ſecure the Lender will be 200 thouſand pounds. I ſay this being lyable to make good all Moneys the <hi>Bankers</hi> ſhall receive and take up, then there is no fear but the Lender will have his ends anſwered and his Moneys well ſecured. And it is certain ſuch an Anchorage, Fund and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36927:22"/>being once laid, will mount that <hi>Bank</hi> within Two Months to ſix hundred thouſand pounds, (and higher it ought not to go.) Then out comes the Moneys unimployed from all perſons in or near <hi>London;</hi> Even Servants, Men and Maids, will tumble in their Moneys as faſt at one end of the <hi>Bank</hi> as it can be told out; And at the other end it is tumbled out again into Trade to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and ſuch as ſtand in need of ready Moneys, and thereby Trade is made eaſie and much convenienced. And then it will be true with us what Sr. <hi>William Temple</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in his Book of his Obſervations of the <hi>Nether-lands,</hi> That when the <hi>Bankers</hi> there ſend to the people that have lent them Moneys to come and fetch their principal and intereſt, then, ſaith he, <hi>they come with Tears in their Eyes deſiring them to continue it.</hi> But in <hi>England</hi> many times Men may cry out their Eyes before they get either principal or intereſt. What a comfort would this be to Widdows and Orphans, and all ſuch as know not how, or dare not ſet out their Moneys at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, their Moneys now lying dead on their hands, if this were done? And by this <hi>Bank,</hi> and it's Credit will ſpring up a Lumber-houſe, nay many in the City of <hi>London</hi> to force Trade, to give to people one Commodity for the other, the things now offer'd at by many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at <hi>Devonſhire</hi> houſe. But they having no Fund, Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſecure Foundation, it can come to nothing; theſe Lumber-houſes grow out of the ſides of the grand <hi>Banks,</hi> which are in all parts and ever ſhall be the Anchor and Cable of all ſmaller <hi>Banks.</hi> If it ſhall pleaſe God once to raiſe a Bank in <hi>London</hi> of ſix hundred thouſand pounds Fund and Anchorage, out of ſuch a <hi>Bank</hi> will ſprout out many Lumber houſes and ſmaller <hi>Banks,</hi> to quicken Trade. And certainly then the Moneys will be lent at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36927:22"/>four in the hundred, and ready Moneys at all times upon unperiſhable Commodities, even to three parts of four of the Value, as doth the King of <hi>Swetheland</hi> with his Iron and Copper at <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> I could write a whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the advantage it would be to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trades, the growth and manufactures of our own Kingdom: But you ſhall have a touch or two. When I ſpeak of putting all the poor of <hi>England</hi> at work with the growth of our own Country (here to be manufactured) I do know four perſons in <hi>England,</hi> the Father and three Sons, that are in a great Trade, and I believe they Return more moneys in Trade than any two Merchants or Traders in <hi>England,</hi> which have their moneys at five in the Hundred. And I have heard many ſay, that they had rather let them have their moneys at four in the Hundred, than any others at ſix, becauſe it was ſafe, and they could have it again when they pleas'd. But the Reaſon of all this is, the Anchorage is ſafe, they having a great real and perſonal Eſtate. And thus it will be with any <hi>Bank</hi> that ſhall be ſettled upon a good, ſecure, and unperiſhable foundation, into which moneys will be tumbled at ſmall Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Now I have ſhewed you what the Credit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a <hi>Bank</hi> well ſettled will be of one Street in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> but what will the Credit of a <hi>Bank</hi> be, if once all the new buildings in and near the City of <hi>London,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the late Fire, come under a Regiſter! O you with Gold Chains, I will tell you half the Houſes in the City cannot miſs coming into the publick <hi>Bank,</hi> to build and help to lay a Foundation to that rich, that deſirable, that juſt, beneficial and honourable thing: And the other half of the Houſes will be good Security to the Owners to take up moneys upon them, to ſerve their occaſions, and drive their Trades with eaſe. Then the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36927:23"/>Houſes will riſe in their Rents, the Trade will return to the City, the Rats and Mice will leave the Houſes (now only inhabited by them) Honour and Honeſty will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. I have met with many that make theſe Objections. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Lawyers will be againſt it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> All Gentlemen in Debt will be againſt it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All the Lawyers in the Houſe of Commons, and Gentlemen in the Houſe in Debt will be againſt it. And, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It will undo thouſands of People, for in producing their Writings holes will be pickt in their Titles.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> If the Lawyers Eſtates will riſe in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe from ſixteen to thirty years, then certainly his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily will be better provided for by that way, and I was ſaying, more juſtly than now practiſed: And if I do not miſtake, it will make Trade much more large in the Kingdom than now it is, which makes more for the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. And let the Lawyers and all others conſider, the Free Lands of <hi>England</hi> are not the one fifth part; and ſo all that is deſired is but two Feathers out of their Gooſe, and there will be ſufficient plucking and picking work beſides. And for ten years there will be more Law than ever to clear up Titles, to make them fit to come into this voluntary Regiſter. The benefit of all theſe things certainly will be much more to the Lawyers Advantage than what they get by their preſent practice. As to the <hi>Second,</hi> "The Gentlemen in debt will be againſt it; I ſay no they will not, for it will pay their debts without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and that is their Intereſt, the undeniable truth of that you have at large in this diſcourſe. As to the <hi>Third,</hi> you ſay, <q>The Lawyers and Gentlemen in the houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> in debt will be againſt it.</q> My anſwer to that is, That two worthy Members of the houſe of Commons whoſe eſtates are encumbred, ſay, they are wholly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36927:23"/>of the abſolute neceſſity and the advantage of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, and will carry the Bill into the Houſe when a fit opportunity offers it ſelf. And I queſtion not, but before that time all the People of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially thoſe poor Cities and Towns that depend upon Trade, and want Credit and Stock, will diſcourſe their Parliament Men in theſe things hinted at, who thereby will ſee the neceſſity of a Regiſter. As to the <hi>Fourth</hi> Objection, and indeed it was a ſtring that the Lawyers held hard at, <q>That it would undo thouſands of Families, becauſe that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their Writings holes would be pickt in their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and Gentlemen would not Let their Eſtates be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</q> I ſay here is a Salve to cover all this Sore; that is, the Regiſter is voluntary, not compellable, ſo he that will Regiſter may, and he that will not may chuſe; and there will be Lands Regiſtred ſufficient to encourage Trade upon a ſudden. And thoſe that will make uſe of the Lawyers, and the Charge attending the Law, may purſue their old way; and I will promiſe them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have Regiſtred will not be angry with them. But I will plainly ſhew you how the perſon Regiſtring (who poſſibly owes Ten thouſand pounds, and hath made three or four Mortgages of a Thouſand pounds a year) will pay his Debts without Moneys, and will then ſee the Lawyers Objections are only made for their own good, that they may pick ſome more Feathers off him.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe the Mayor of <hi>Warwick</hi> having a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year owes Ten thouſand pounds; he comes and Regiſters his Lands, and when the Law ſaith, it ſhall be a good Title, no man having entred a Claim, then the Mayor of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Land is a good Title. By this Credit the Mayor ſhall have his Land riſe price within ſix Months to ſix and twenty years Purchaſe. The Mayor ſells off
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36927:24"/>ſo much Land as pays the Ten thouſand pounds, and hath as much in value left as he had before, (and his Debts paid,) and hath then freed himſelf from all the Charge that attends the Law, and is alſo able to provide for his Family, and be an Inſtrument for the good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and place where he lives. Whereas before, having but a Thouſand pounds a year, and owing Ten thouſand pounds, he was valued worth nothing, his Family neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and not provided for, and all his buſineſs was to fence with the aſſiſtance of Lawyers, to keep off and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Conſumption which his Eſtate was then lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to.</p>
               <p>Then ſuppoſe the Mayor of <hi>Coventry</hi> hath One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year, and oweth Ten thouſand pounds, and hath mortgaged his Lands to four ſeveral perſons, one knowing not of the Mortgage to the other: He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what the Mayor of <hi>Warwick</hi> hath done, that he hath paid his Ten thouſand pounds, and freed himſelf from all Incumbrances, (and hath as good an Eſtate as before,) what do you think he will do? I tell you what he will do, he will go to all perſons he hath mortgaged his Land to, and confeſs the truth, and deſire them to come with him, and all Regiſter their Titles, when the Law ſaith that theſe Titles ſhall be good: Then the Mayor of <hi>Coventry</hi> by virtue of theſe Regiſtred Lands, doth the ſame thing that the Mayor of <hi>Warwick</hi> did before. And I wiſh that the Members of Parliament for <hi>Warwick, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> Shires, would ſeriouſly conſider of what is here aſſerted; and if they are convinc't of the truth hereof, let them purſue the ends for the obtaining of it, and they will quickly find the benefit thereof.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Scotland</hi> is under a Regiſter, and worth twenty four years Purchaſe; and on the other ſide in the North
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36927:24"/>of <hi>Ireland,</hi> although but three Hours Sail, is worth but eight years Purchaſe; and in <hi>England</hi> on this ſide <hi>Twede,</hi> it is worth but ſixteen years Purchaſe; the Regiſter is the Cauſe. The Mannor of <hi>Taunton Dean</hi> in <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> is under a Regiſter, and there the Land is worth three and twenty years Purchaſe, although but a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Mannor, and at any time he that hath One hundred pounds a year in the Mannor of <hi>Taunton,</hi> may go to the Caſtle and take up Two thouſand pounds upon his Lands, and buy Stuffs with the money, and go to <hi>London</hi> and ſell his Stuff, and Return down his moneys, and pay but five in the hundred for his moneys, and diſcharge his Lands. This is the Cauſe of the great Trade and Riches in and about <hi>Taunton Dean,</hi> (O happy <hi>Taunton Dean!</hi>) What Gentleman can do thus with Free-lands? No, it is not worth ſixteen years Purchaſe all <hi>England</hi> over, one place with another; and if not timely put under a Regiſter, it will come to twelve years Purchaſe before long. Now you ſee a Regiſter is practicable in <hi>Scotland</hi> and alſo in <hi>England;</hi> And if it were ſo by Act of Parliament in theſe particular places I have formerly mentioned in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there would be no Complaint for want of People or Trade in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks I hear ſome object and ſay, Although <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be under a Regiſter, yet that is a very poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. There are many reaſons to be given wherefore <hi>Scotland</hi> might be very poor; And if it were not under a Regiſter the Land would not be worth eight years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; But being under a Regiſter you ſee how much it exceeds the Lands in <hi>England</hi> in purchaſe. <hi>Scotland</hi> is ruled by a Commiſſioner, and there you cannot expect that which you may where the Monarch keeps his Court. For here the Merchants have acceſs with ſpeed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36927:25"/>and eaſe to have their grievances heard and redreſſed. But in tributary Kingdoms there ever were and ever will be ſelf-intereſt Parties to keep as much as in them lyes, the Peoples grievances from the Princes knowledge, provided they can thereby feather their own Neſts. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Flanders</hi> and the Vice-roys that have been ſent by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to govern there. But <hi>Scotland</hi> is not under half the Improvement, or ever will be, as <hi>England</hi> is; For in <hi>England</hi> there are large Rivers, and well ſcituated for Trade, great Woods, Mynes, good Wooll and large Beaſts. In <hi>Scotland</hi> very little Woods, few Iron Mynes, courſe Wooll, and often great part of the Sheep are ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And no Northern Kingdom is or ever will be of any great Riches, or are capable thereof: But ſuch will as have theſe things abounding in them, good Ports, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Laws for Trade, good Wooll, and good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities thereof, much and well Wooded, with plenty of Iron, Stone and Pit Coales, with Lands fit to bear Flax, with Mynes of Tin and Lead. <hi>Scotland</hi> is a thin and lean Kingdom, and wanting in theſe things. <hi>England</hi> is a fat Kingdom, and hath all theſe things in it. Yet the <hi>Lothean</hi> Lands in <hi>Scotland</hi> are twenty four years purchaſe. At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> there is a Grand Regiſter, and in each County a particular one, and no man can be there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a Purchaſe unleſs it be his own fault. <hi>England</hi> is at ſixteen years Purchaſe. The reaſon is obvious why <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt be ſo, and why <hi>England</hi> is ſo. But a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Regiſter in <hi>England</hi> will cure all, and put us ſix years purchaſe above <hi>Scotland.</hi> For as I formerly ſaid, as our Honour and Honeſty is, ſo will be our Riches; and Riches bring Trade, and Trade brings ſtrength to an Iſland. And for want of good Titles let the world judge what a Condition we are coming into.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:36927:25"/>
               <p>I will give you one ſmall Inſtance, what the poor decayed Trade and Clothiers of <hi>England</hi> would be able to do in eaſing themſelves, and making their Trade com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, if they had but the Authority of the Law to Regiſter all their Houſes and Lands. Take it from the City of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> there I make the Precedent, and as it would be with them, ſo it would be with all the Towns in <hi>England</hi> who deal in the Wollen and Iron Manufacture. Suppoſe the Clothiers in and near <hi>Salisbury</hi> have two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year in free Lands, and their Lands were by Law fixt under a Regiſter, then the Anchorage and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Bank will be at leaſt fifty thouſand pounds; And immediately tumbles into them all the idle Moneys, nay Moneys now under Ground, (and good part of the plate) ten Miles round; The Uſurer will pray, and the Men and Maid-ſervants will beg to take in their Moneys. Immediately one hundred thouſand pounds will be brought in, and at four in the hundred. What will this do to the poor Clothiers? Nay what will it do to each Gentleman, and all men near <hi>Salisbury</hi> that have or keep Sheep? I ſay the help and preſent Credit of this great Bank and Caſh will raiſe the price of Wooll, and ſet the Poor at work; Thereby enabling the Tenants to pay their Rents, keep the poor of the Pariſh, bring the Clothiers and the City into a Comfortable Condition; but moſt of all it will prevent the Trade departing this Kingdom, which of neceſſity it will do, if not timely prevented. For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll carried away with their Beef to <hi>Holland, France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> their making Cloth of cheap Wooll with cheap Victuals, with Moneys at three in the hundred, will out do us, and undo us too if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

And in this caſe here's nothing deſired, but that Men thus qualified with Lands may employ it by the Authority of the Law to the good of themſelves and mankind, and to be juſtly honeſt to all.</p>
               <p>Now methinks I hear many of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſay, But how may this be done which you ſay? I tell you how: deſire your Parliament Man to draw you up a Bill and carry it into the Houſe the next ſitting. But you will ſay, he will not do it. Then get your Biſhop to do it. You will ſay, he is no Lawyer. Pray tell him it is eaſier than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the River Navigable. But a Regiſter and the River Navigable together will do rarely well.

And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What Security ſhall he give to perform his Truſt?</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> let the Regiſter be kept by two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen whom you have experience of for Honour and Honeſtie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> let the Regiſter be choſen by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36927:28"/>Major voyces of all the Free-holders in and within ten Miles of the City of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who have forty ſhillings a year and upwards. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let him be choſen by the way of the Baletting Box. I will tell you how that is: Every Free-holder muſt have Bowls given them of ſeveral Colours, when they ſee who ſtand to be Regiſters. Then let <hi>A.</hi> be for the White Bowle, <hi>B.</hi> for the Black Bowle, <hi>C.</hi> for the Red Bowle, <hi>D.</hi> for the Green Bowle, and ſo on; and when the Parties appear, each Free-holder drops into the Baletting Box one Bowle in a piece of Paper that none can ſee the Colour, either Black, White, Red or Green. So he that hath moſt Bowles is the man. And by this way no man knows how to find fault with his pretended Friend, or knows who is his Enemy. And certainly this way would drive out baſe intereſts and prefer men of Honeſty, and Honour. And for chuſing of Parliament men and all publick Votes in Corporations, it were happy it were ſo; for great things are done in ſome parts of the World by this little Policie. To the <hi>Fourth,</hi> [who ſhall pay him for his pains.] I ſay he ought to have it out of the Lands Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred; but have a care of allowing too much.

               </p>
               <p>Reader, by this time I hope I have convinced thee of the neceſſity of the Free-lands being put under a voluntary Regiſter; And I will now ſhew to all men the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the bad Securities by Land at this day. Until about thirty years paſt the Conveyances and Settlements of Lands were three wayes, viz. <hi>Firſt,</hi> by a Deed inrolled in <hi>Chancerie,</hi> which creates a Poſſeſſion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> a Deed and Fine, which doth the ſame. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by a Deed executed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith Livery and Seiſin upon the Land. Two of theſe are upon Record, and the third was an Act which was done publickly, whereby the Country might have notice of the transferring the Land, and then there was poſſibility of Titles to be known. But now by the occaſion of the late Warrs, and things relating thereunto, there are three things that give liberty to all men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud whom they pleaſe, and it is not in the power of man to prevent it. Firſt the ſettlement by Leaſe and Releaſe, a thing that unhinges the whole Free-hold Lands of <hi>England.</hi> For whereas before the people had the other three ways to ſettle their Eſtates, two of which were upon Record, the third of publick Acts in doing of it, by which the Country might take notice thereof; now this private pocket-ſettlement called Leaſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, may be done in any Corner privately, and ſhall be good againſt all perſons. The way is this: <hi>Firſt,</hi> a Leaſe is made for a year of the premiſes, which by the practice of the Law gives a poſſeſſion; then in another Deed the Leaſe is recited, and a Deed of Releaſe made, both which Convey the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee. This may be done in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:36927:29"/>and the Leaſe left in the hands of the perſon whom it was made to; and the Grantor brings away the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe with him. The year is expired, then the Lands are ſold, and a Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> is preferr'd, and the partie ſwears no Incumbrance, and gets a great ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; then delivers the Releaſe to the party that had the Leaſe for the year. Then the Title is veſted in the Leaſe and Releaſe. Then he comes and Ejects him that bought for valuable Conſideration, becauſe he had the proper Title. I could name ſix perſons that were ſerved ſo, and one of them not under the degree of a Sergeant at Law. And pray now what Lawyer knows a Title? The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> ſort are the private Settlements made to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or in the War; they were done by the Royaliſts to preſerve them againſt the Parliament party; the like did the Parliament party do to preſerve them againſt the Kings party; the like doth the Romaniſt at this day. I have been a Commiſſioner in many of theſe Titles, and they are ſtill kept on Foot to play faſt or looſe as they pleaſe; ſome of which are every Term heard of in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Hall. The <hi>Third</hi> are Bonds given to the King, although made in an Ale-houſe or Tavern, and never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Exchequer, nor in any Court elſe; yet theſe Bonds are a Judgment in Law, and by virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be firſt ſerved, (and before all men elſe.) And at this day many Gentlemen (and others that I know) have ſold Land ſince they entred into theſe Bonds, and the Bonds not ſatisfied. I ſpeak this with honour to the King's Prerogative, and affirm that it would be more for his Majeſty's advantage alſo, if Eſtates were Regiſtred, for he would then ſee what Security he has for his Money, whereas his Majeſty himſelf is many times a loſer, by truſting upon inſufficient Security. And it is now a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36927:29"/>common practice to convey away all Lands before a man becomes bound to the King.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe Uncertainties of Titles of Land, it is brought ſo to paſs at this day, that whatever Moneys is or hath been borrowed, by Companies Incorporated, or upon the Credit, or under the Common Seal of Cities or Corporations, none can be recovered by Law. I hope now no Gentleman of the Long Robe can pretend to know a good Title from a bad, and therefore will be now willing to let the Free-lands of <hi>England</hi> to be put under a voluntary Regiſter.</p>
               <p>But I hear ſome ſay, That for all that hath been ſaid in this Diſcourſe they are not ſatisfied, the <hi>Dutch</hi> will be beat without fighting. Well then, I will give you ſome more ſatisfaction. I pray obſerve what the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> have been doing for this many years; it has been courting and fighting for this Miſtreſs called Trade. And obſerve how the <hi>Dutch</hi> have fitted her with all that ſhe can deſire; as with a Regiſter of Lands, Banks, Lumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, cut Rivers, eaſie Ports in point of Cuſtoms, a Court of Merchants: And theſe give her delights, and ſhe hath no mind to depart from them. And her long continuance hath made her Lovers vaſtly rich, and the Towns where ſhe maketh her abode, both populous and great. And though in the Three Maritime Provinces they have neither good Water nor good Air, yet are their Lands at fifty years Purchaſe. Now obſerve, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> lyes within twenty Hours ſail of <hi>Holland,</hi> and is ſtored with many and much better Ports than <hi>Holland</hi> hath: And our Ships by reaſon of the deepneſs of our Rivers, can go out and come in with much greater Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens than theirs can, and we lye as well to the <hi>Baltick</hi> as they, and much better to the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> Eaſt and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36927:30"/>Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> than they do. And in <hi>England</hi> are Noble Seats to be purchaſed, and a good Air. Now Reader, doſt thou think, that the great <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants and others rich in Caſh, would ſtay there, if we had here publick Security for our Lands, that they might purchaſe ſafely here? I ſay they would come over in Swarms, and would willingly give thirty years purchaſe for Lands here. So that the great Merchants coming from thence, and buying Eſtates here, will bring away the great Riches from thence, and ſo increaſe Trade here; and thereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> will decline gradually every year more and more, and within very few years their beloved Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs will depart, and will come and ſettle her ſelf with us. And as we are an Iſland which God and Nature hath fitted for Trade, if we once fit our ſelves with Laws an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, then the greateſt part of the Trade of <hi>Europe</hi> will be with us. And if this doth not convince the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that hereby we ſhall beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> without fighting, and pay our Debts without Moneys, I have no more to ſay.</p>
               <p>Beſide the Advantages aforeſaid, let me tell you that I have found out two places, one in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the other in <hi>England:</hi> In that in <hi>Ireland</hi> are great and ſtrange quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Timber to build Ships, and places to build them, and at three fifths of the Rates the King now builds at, with convenient places to lay up the Ships, and thereby to be ready upon all occaſions. That in <hi>England</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to build Ships at, and at very eaſie Rates, and is as good a Harbour to lay them up in as any is in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in the very Eye of <hi>France.</hi> And I deſire it may be ſeriouſly conſidered. And that the truth may be demonſtrated of what I ſay, I have affixed two ſheets in Maps to this Book, whereby the truth aſſerted may be made the more clear.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:36927:30"/>
               <p>About two years ſince, I was prevailed upon by ſome of the Money Bankers, and ſome Gentlemen to go over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland</hi> to Survey ſome Iron works, Woods and Lands which they were in propoſition for, with Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> being Works, Lands, and Woods lying near the River <hi>Slane</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Wexford</hi> and <hi>Wicklow,</hi> and formerly ſet on Foot by Sir <hi>John Cutler,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Heath,</hi> Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> the Scrivener, Docter <hi>Yates</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Timothy Stamp,</hi> and from them Conveyed to Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> to advance a ſum of Moneys, and to manage the Works and to give an Accompt: But the Parties differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome bad Titles made with ſuits at Law had ſo unhinged and debaſed the whole affair, that nothing poſſibly could be done, unleſs we could come upon ſome new Foundation. So my ſelf and ſervants ſpent ſome time in Surveying the Woods, Lands and Works, in which I did evidently perceive the Deſign at the firſt was very rationally laid, but unfortunately deſtroyed. I then conſidered what might be done. After I had ſurveyed the River <hi>Slane,</hi> and the Brooks and Rivulets running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame, and the Woods adjoyning unto them, with that noble great and good Wood called <hi>Shelela,</hi> I then did perfectly ſee what a great ſhame it was that ſuch quantities of Timber ſhould ly rotting in theſe Woods, and could not be come at, the Mountains and Boggs having ſo lockt them up, that they could not be brought to any Sea-port to be imployed in building of Ships. But my ſelf and thoſe I employed having ſpent much time in the ſurveying the ſaid River <hi>Slane</hi> and the Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets running into it, we found that they may be made ſo Navigable for Ten thouſand pounds, as all thoſe Woods may with eaſe and at very cheap Rates be brought down
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36927:31"/>the <hi>Slane</hi> to <hi>Wexford,</hi> and to other places near thereunto, to build Men of War and other Ships. And I know in the Woods near unto the <hi>Slane,</hi> that may come down that River, (if once Navigable) there is Timber ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make a hundred Men of War (and ſome hundreds of Buſſes) and as good Timber as any is in <hi>England,</hi> (I was going to ſay better) and not one ſtick wanting that Oak is capable of doing: And the firſt lengths of Maſts alſo, (and they will ſerve well for that uſe.) And as now theſe Woods are (and as they will for ever be, unleſs by ſome ſuch way relieved) they will never bring the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Twenty thouſand pounds, (nor Ten I verily believe.) But if the <hi>Slane</hi> were made Navigable and the Rivulets running into it, theſe great quantities of Timber might be employed in building Ships for the Royal Navy, and may if his Majeſty pleaſe, be kept either in an Admiralty at <hi>Wexford,</hi> or in ſome Port near, or in <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, and there they will be ready to ſail upon any occaſion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preſerve the Weſt <hi>India</hi> Trade, or into the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean,</hi> and thereby give great comfort to all Trade that is uſed in thoſe Seas; as alſo incourage the People, and drive away their preſent fears. And I am very well ſatisfied that Ships of all Rates will be built at <hi>Wexford</hi> or thereabouts at three fifths of what the King now pays for building; and there they may be alſo Gun'd and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled. The Woods are the Earl of <hi>Angleſeys,</hi> the Lord <hi>Baltimores,</hi> Sir <hi>Laurence Eſmonds,</hi> the Lord <hi>Arons,</hi> and <hi>Shelela</hi> the Earl of <hi>Straffords,</hi> with many other ſmall Woods. Here you have the Map of the River and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets, with ſome ſmall Signs of the Woods before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

               <figure/>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> great advantage is, that there the King may have all his Iron made, and Guns caſt at very cheap Rates. There is the Iron Stone in the Sea, by the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour mouth, and the King hath vaſt quantities of Woods decayed in <hi>New Foreſt;</hi> of which at this time Charcoal is made, and Shipt away to <hi>Cornwall</hi> and other parts. If two Furnaces be built about <hi>Ringwood</hi> to caſt Guns, and two Forges to make Iron, and the Iron Stone be brought from the Harbour mouth out of the Sea up the River to the Furnaces, and the Charcole out of <hi>New Foreſt</hi> to the works, there being ſufficient of decayed Woods to ſupply four Iron-works for ever; by theſe means the King makes the beſt of every thing, and builds with his own Timber being near and convenient; whereas now the charge and carriage makes the Timber 07 of no uſe to him. And having Iron Stone of his own for gathering up, and Wood of his own for nothing, he will have very cheap Guns and Iron. And all theſe things ſet together, this is a buſineſs befitting a King to have. And as I ſaid, this Fort will be made, and anſwer the ends I here lay down, for two thouſand pounds, and the Iron works built and Docks to build three Ships at one time for eight thouſand pounds. The diſcovery more particular of the place of the deep Water and Fort to be made, and the Harbour within, with a deſcription of the Camp adjoyning is here in the Map affixed.</p>
               <p>Now Reader, I hope I have made good my promiſe of diſcovering two places convenient to build Ships in, and at eaſie Rates, and alſo to lay them up ſafe, and in places that are eminently convenienced for quick getting out and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36927:37"/>could ſay much more of theſe two places as to publick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, but it may be, and it is not to be queſtioned, I ſhall meet with Enemies for ſaying ſo much, for I know now almoſt all men are Sacrificing all things to their own Nets and Drags, or to ſuch Great ones as they lye under. However if his Majeſty pleaſe to Command me, I will go to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> with any knowing perſon, and there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place ſhew him all that is here affirmed, (and the Reaſons:) the like I will do as to the <hi>Slane</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Woods I ſo commend, joyning thereunto; and upon the place demonſtrate and make out how the River <hi>Slane</hi> and Rivulets running into the ſame, may be made Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable; and ſhew the great quantities of Timber that may thereby be brought down to build Men of War, the places convenient for building them, and that no King or Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> hath ſuch an advantage to build Ships as the King of <hi>England</hi> may have with that Timber in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>AS to Linen Cloth of all ſorts, what vaſt quantities are yearly brought into <hi>England,</hi> and here made uſe of, and by us ſent unto our Iſlands, and to many other places, the making of which ſets at work abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People in other Nations; as alſo Threads, Tapes, Twine for Cordage, and wrought Flax? Now who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36927:37"/>makes the fine Linen Clothes, and where have they the Materials? I ſay the fine Linens are made in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> that is, woven and whitened there, but the Thread that makes them comes out of <hi>Germany</hi> from <hi>Saxony, Bohemia,</hi> and other parts thereabouts, and is brought down the <hi>Elbe</hi> and <hi>Rhine</hi> in dry Fats for <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and there the Merchants have at this day, and ſo will ever have, a vaſt Trade in theſe Commodities, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that Trade of Linen be advanced in <hi>England,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged as I ſhall ſet down. But, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Obſerve that the People of <hi>Holland</hi> eat dear and pay great Rents for their Houſes, and ſo they do in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but the weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and whitening of the Cloth is not above the tenth part of the labour. For the great labour is in preparing the Flax, as pulling, watering, dreſſing, ſpinning, and winding, and all this is done in the upper parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and thereabouts; there Victuals are cheap, and in all theſe parts there is no Beggar, nor no occaſion to beg; and in all Towns there are Schools for little Girls, from ſix years old and upwards, to teach them to ſpin, and ſo to bring their tender Fingers by degrees to ſpin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine, which being young are thereby eaſily fitted for that uſe. Whereas People overgrown in age cannot ſo well feel the Thread. Their Wheels go all by the foot, made to go with much eaſe, whereby the action or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is very eaſie and delightful. And in all Towns there are Schools according to the bigneſs, or multitude of the poor Children. I will here ſhew you the way, method, rule, and order how they are Governed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a large Room, and in the middle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a little Box like a Pulpit. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are Benches built round about the Room as they are in our Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes; upon the Benches ſit about two hundred Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36927:38"/>ſpinning, and in the Box in the middle of the Room ſits the Grand Miſtreſs with a long white Wand in her hand. If ſhe obſerves any of them idle, ſhe reaches them a tap; but if that will not do, ſhe rings a Bell which by a little Cord is fixt to the Box, and out comes a Woman; ſhe then points to the Offender, and ſhe is taken away into another Room and chaſtiſed. And all this is done without one word ſpeaking. And I believe this way of ordering the young Women in <hi>Germany</hi> is one great cauſe that the <hi>German</hi> Women have ſo little of the twit twat. And I am ſure it would be well were it ſo in <hi>England.</hi> And it is clear, that the leſs there is of ſpeaking, the more there may be of working. In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Room by the School there is a Woman that is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and putting Flax on the Diſtaffs, and upon the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bell, and pointing the Rod at the Maid that hath ſpun off her Flax, ſhe hath another Diſtaff given her, and her Spool of Thread taken from her, and put into a Box unto others of the ſame ſize to make Cloth.</p>
               <p>And obſerve what Advantages they make of ſuiting their Threads to make Cloth, all being of equal Threads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They raiſe their Children as they ſpin finer to the higher Benches. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſort and ſize all the Threads ſo, that they can apply them to make equal Cloaths. Whereas here in <hi>England</hi> one Woman, or good Houſewife, hath it may be ſix or eight Spinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to her, and at ſome odd times ſhe ſpins, and alſo her Children and Servants, and all this Thread ſhall go together, ſome for Woof, ſome for Warp, to make a piece of Cloth. And as the Linen is Manufactured in <hi>England</hi> at this day, it cannot be otherwiſe. And is it not a pity and ſhame, that the young Children and Maids here in <hi>England</hi> ſhould be idle within <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36927:39"/>tearing Hedges, or robbing Orchards, and worſe, when theſe, and theſe alone, are the people that may, and muſt if ever, ſet up this Trade of making fine Linen here? And after a young Maid hath been three years in the ſpinning School, that is taken in at ſix and then continues until nine years, ſhe will get eight pence the day. And in theſe parts I ſpeak of, a man that has moſt Children lives beſt; whereas here he that has moſt is pooreſt. There the Children enrich the Father, but here begger him.</p>
               <p>Joining to this Spinning-School are three more Schools, ordered as this ſpoken of is. One is for Maids weaving Bone-lace, another for Boys making Toys, ſome cutting the Heads, ſome the Bodies, ſome the Legs; the third is for Boys painting the Toys and ſlit Pictures.</p>
               <p>I know theſe Queſtions will be put or asked: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Where would you have this Trade ſettled in <hi>England? Secondly,</hi> How ſhall there be Flax provided for to manage this Trade? And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Where ſhall be Stock at firſt, and where can we have places to whiten? I Anſwer, <hi>Warwick, Leiceſter, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> Shires are the places fit to ſet up this Manufacture, becauſe in theſe Countries there is at preſent no Staple Trade, and the Land there for Flax is very good, being rich and dry, wherein Flax doth abundantly delight. And I affirm, that the Flax that grows in theſe parts, ſhall do any thing that the <hi>German</hi> or any other Flax can do, provided it be ordered accordingly. As to the ſecond and third, (as to Flax and Stock) let each County begin with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds Stock apiece immediately to provide Houſes as before ſet down, and employ it as is directed. And for places to Whiten, near all the great Towns there are Brooks or Rivers where bleeching places may be made in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36927:40"/>the Lands adjoining, as is in <hi>Southwark</hi> by help of the flowing of the <hi>Thames.</hi> And for Men and Women to Govern the Trade, I know in every Country there are Men ſufficient to direct and order it.</p>
               <p>I know it will be much inquired into by many, why <hi>Warwick, Leiceſter, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Oxford-ſhires</hi> ſhould be the places fixed on for the Linnen Manufacture before all other Counties in <hi>England?</hi> I anſwer, there are no Counties in <hi>England</hi> ſo capable of making the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity ſo good and ſo cheap as theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> their Land is excellent good to produce Flax. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Counties, and have no ſtaple Manufacture at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fixt with them; whereby their poor are idle and want imployment. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they are Counties the beſt furniſhed at all times with Corn and Fleſh of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>England,</hi> and at cheapeſt Rates. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they are in the heart of <hi>England,</hi> and the Trade being once well ſetled in theſe Counties will influence their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Counties in the ſame Manufacture in ſending their Flax and threads with eaſe and cheapneſs down the Rivers <hi>Thames, Avon, Trent,</hi> and St <hi>Eades:</hi> all which Navigable Rivers come into theſe Counties. And I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it is not poſſible to ſet up this Trade in any other part of <hi>England</hi> with ſucceſs but in theſe places, becauſe in moſt part of <hi>England</hi> there are fixt Manufactures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready that do in great meaſure ſet the poor at work. In the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> clothing of all ſorts, as in <hi>Gloceſter, Worceſter, Shropſhire, Staffordſhire,</hi> and a ſmall part of <hi>Warwickſhire:</hi> In <hi>Derby, Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the Iron and Wollen Manufacture: In <hi>Suffolk, Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Wollen Manufacture: In <hi>Kent, Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> ſome Cloth, Iron, and Materials for Shipping. Then to Counties to raiſe proviſions and to vend them
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36927:41"/>at <hi>London</hi> to feed that great Mouth, are <hi>Cambridge, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington, Buckingham, Hartford, Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Berks.</hi> And if you rightly weigh and conſider how <hi>England</hi> is fixed in all parts as to the Growth, Trade, Manufacture, and vending thereof, there are no Counties in <hi>England</hi> that this deſirable gainful improvement of the Linen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture poſſibly can be managed in, with the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as in the forementioned Counties. For as Common Honeſty is neceſſary for Trade, and without it Trade will decay: ſo any Manufacture fixed in any place where it may be better accommodated, thither it will go, and ſo remove from the place where it was firſt ſet up; and the diſcouragments it received there many times keep it from fixing any where elſe. About ſeven or eight years ſince there was a Propoſal of ſetting up the Linen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture in and near <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> a Town of two hundred void houſes, to be had for little, and near the Sea: but I coming to that Town was preſt hard to give my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the Linen Trade might be there ſet up with ſucceſs? After I had rid about the Town as far as <hi>Catta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> Bridge, and obſerved the Influence that the <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Trade had there; as alſo the Stuff and Say Trade, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Poor were comfortably ſupplyed: I then found it was impoſſible to go on with ſucceſs, and gave my reaſons, upon which all was laid aſide, and my reaſons approved of. I did alſo acquaint one of the Grandees of the Linen Trade at <hi>Clarken-well,</hi> that that Trade would eat out its own Bowels, Stock and Block would come to nothing. And ſo it ſhall do in the Countries I name, and in all other places in the World, being a new Manufacture, unleſs the Publick Authority take care and cheriſh it, for at leaſt ſeven years. The way how, I will ſet down when I have finiſhed my Diſcourſe of this and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36927:42"/>the Iron Manufacture; for it is as fit to be done for the incouragement of the Iron Manufacture, as for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Manufacture. And obſerve, I pray you, theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I now name for the Linen Manufacture, employ more hands at work by their growth, than any eight Counties of <hi>England</hi> do by the growth of theirs, and all employed abroad in other Counties, not in their own. And the great cauſe of Strength and Riches to <hi>England</hi> are thoſe great quantities of Wool which grow in their great Paſtures, and are ſent abroad into the Weſt and other parts, and there Manufactured, where they keep at work infinite quantities of poor people, as Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Carders, Weavers, Dreſſers, Dyers. Yet I have ſeen two pieces in Print, each making great complaint, that by the late Incloſures in theſe Counties, a Dog and a Boy do manage as much Lands as formerly employed ten Teams, and kept forty perſons at work all the year. Never conſidering that the Land incloſed is treble the benefit to the Owner (after the Miniſters and Poors part was thrown out) over what it was before it was incloſed; and that the product of the Wool proceeding from the ſame Land, does ſet at work five times the number of people in other places of the Kingdom. And ſo it will be with the Linen Manufactures, if once well ſettled in theſe four Counties, and incouraged by a Publick Law. Then theſe Counties will be as <hi>Germany</hi> is to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders:</hi> There the Flax will grow, and be Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eaſily and cheap; part whitened there, and the Thread and part of the Flax ſent down the Navigable Rivers to the ſeveral Towns to be woven and ſpun. And ſo there will be employ for the greateſt part of the Poor of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And in ſuch Towns where it meets with a ſettled vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Regiſter, thence never will it depart.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:36927:42"/>
               <p>But I muſt now name you ſome Lands in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties very fit for Flax, thereby to make you know the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the reſt, with its quantities; as alſo ſhow you the quantities of Flax that may grow upon one Mannor in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and the number of poor people it will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy: by which Demonſtrations you may judge what may be done in the four Counties named in this Deſign offered at.</p>
               <p>For this twelve years laſt paſt, I having my <hi>London</hi> Road through <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> made my Obſervations of the Land there, and the fitneſs of it to bear Flax; but more particularly of the Mannor of <hi>Milcott,</hi> being the Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi>'s near <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon.</hi> Which Mannor is about three thouſand Acres, and to the value of three thouſand pounds a year, as I am informed. The Land in this Mannor is ſound, rich, dry, and good, and that is the true Land to bear Flax. And in this Mannor ſome years there are ſown ſome hundred Acres of Flax: But if the whole Mannor were ſown with Flax, it would employ nine thouſand people in the Manufacturing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as to ſowing, weeding, pulling, watering, dreſſing, ſpinning, winding, weaving, and whitening. One part of which labour would be done upon and near the place; the other would be done in remote parts, the Flax and Thread being carried down the River <hi>Avon</hi> into <hi>Severne,</hi> and ſo conveyed with eaſe to <hi>Briſtol, Wales,</hi> and other parts, to ſet the Poor at work, which want employment; and ſo the ſmall Towns will ſet their Poor at work by the ſame Rule as they do in <hi>Germany,</hi> and then there will need no Relief from the Pariſh for the Poor, nor will there be any complaining in the Streets. One Acre of Land will bear three hundred weight of Flax. This three hundred weight of Flax well dreſt and made fine, will
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36927:43"/>make four hundred Ells of Cloth, worth three ſhillings the Ell, which will be in value when it is manufactured threeſcore Pounds. You muſt obſerve, the finer the Thread is, the leſs Flax goeth to make it, and the more Cloth it will make. And ſo there being the labour of three perſons to manufacture the Flax that comes of this one Acre of Land, this Mannor will employ nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons. Now there are at leaſt Ten thouſand Acres of Land beſides this, very good for Flax in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and no leſs quantity in any of the three other Counties, every way as good. Now, Reader, I pray Anſwer me, whether here be not work ſufficient upon the growth and product of our own Land, nay in four Counties where no Manufacture is, to ſet the greateſt part of the Poor of <hi>England</hi> at work; beſides the great advantage it will bring to the Owners of the Lands; and the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of the Country, by fixing ſo great a ſtaple Trade there, and bringing a multitude of People alſo, which is, and ever will be a great enrichment to the place where they are. Witneſs the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> by the Woollen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures; and <hi>Buringham, Sturbridge, Dudly, Waſſal,</hi> and thereabout, for the Iron Manufactures. And I dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, take <hi>Dudly</hi> to be the Center of ten Miles round, conſidering the badneſs of the Land, it is there twice as dear as it is in the four Counties here named. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten Miles round <hi>Dudly,</hi> there are more people inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and more Money returned in a year, than is in theſe four rich fat Counties I mention. And by this Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture we ſhould prevent at leaſt two Millions of Money a year from being ſent out of the Land for Linen Cloth, and keep our people at home who now go beyond the Seas for want of imployment here. For where ever the Country is full of people, they are rich; and where
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36927:43"/>thin, there the place is poor, and all Commodities cheap.</p>
               <p>I could put ſomething further into the Heads of the Gentlemen of theſe Counties, wherein they may have much more added to this preſcribed Linen Trade: but then I fear their Neighbouring Gentlemen will fall at Difference, why one ſhould have ſo much benefit and the other ſo little, as they did when I ſurveyed <hi>Trent</hi> for them in the year one thouſand ſix hundred ſixty five, and a Tax ſhall be laid upon the Stock ſettled, as they did upon mine and Partners, as ſoon as I had made the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Avon</hi> Navigable, and brought Barges to <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know many will ſay, This is a very good way to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the poor, but what ſhall they do for Looms, Slayes, and Wheels for to ſpin and weave this Flax, and how ſhall we make our Flax fine, ſo that we may make fine Cloth, and what ſhall we do for places to whiten it at, for it is ſaid that no place will do it well but at <hi>Haerlem</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that is becauſe of the water in the Mere join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Town.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, thou mayeſt have the Looms, Wheels, and Slayes at firſt out of <hi>Germany</hi> and from <hi>Haerlem:</hi> Two Looms, Two Wheels, and ten Slayes will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make others by; and all theſe thou mayeſt have for twenty pounds. As to the Second, there is much in preparing and fitting of the Flax, ſo as to make it run to a fine Thread. This is the way they do it in <hi>Germany,</hi> and thou mayeſt write by their Copy. Thou muſt twice a year beat thy Flax well and dreſs it well, and take out of it all the filth, and ſo for as long as thou haſt it in thy poſſeſſion, if it be ten years; and the longer thou keepeſt it, the finer it will be, for beating and often dreſſing will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36927:44"/>cauſe the Harle to open, and at laſt it will be ſtrangely fine. There muſt alſo be a Stove in the Room where the Flax is, with Fire in it in all moiſt times, which keeps the Flax dry and prevents Moiſtneſs, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother great cauſe which makes it ſo fine. I have ſeen Flax in <hi>Saxony</hi> twenty years old thus houſ-wife't, which was as fine as the hairs of ones head. It is true there what the old ſaying is here, That Wooll may be kept to Dirt, and Flax to Silk.</p>
               <p>And as to the Second, It is true that their Hollands and Clothes are whitened at <hi>Haerlem,</hi> and by the very ſides of the Lake, and Cuts are conveniently made, and the Lake is much of a height at all times, and ſo it feeds the Cuts with water, that with eaſe they may Sprinkle the Clothes as there is Occaſion; alſo it is well fitted with Houſes by the ſides of the Cuts to boyl the Yarn, and prepare it the ſooner to be white. Theſe are good things, and by the ſituation of the Place and conveniency of the Mere it doth much advance the buſineſs. Rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are there ſeated, that drive great Trades, and there they have a Bank, and their Moneys at three in the Hundred. But as to <hi>Haerlem</hi> Lake, it is ſubject to be mixed with Salt-water, which is brought in the Ships daily from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and there pumpt out into the Lake. And all that can be ſaid for that Water being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other Water in <hi>Holland</hi> is this, that it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtands in a Pool or Lake, and by the influence and heat of the Sun is made ſoft, and ſo very fit for ſcouring, and the like is not in any part of <hi>Holland</hi> elſe. But in <hi>England</hi> we have many places very fit, and by Nature convenient, and with a little Art, as good as <hi>Haerlem,</hi> if not better. And for Inſtance take two places, one at
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36927:44"/>
                  <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> the other at <hi>Coventry.</hi> At <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> upon <hi>Avon</hi> near the Bridge in the Lands of Sir <hi>John Clapton,</hi> by virtue of the Mills pounding high, or at a riſe of Water, he may lead the Water along his own Land, until it come ſo high that no Flood will reach. There Cuts may be made in his Land, and Houſes built with ſpare pieces to bleech the Cloth on, the Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken into the Cuts about the end of <hi>March,</hi> and ſo continued therein, whereby the heat of the Sun will more and more ſoften and fit it for bleeching. The ſecond place is <hi>Coventry;</hi> Almoſt round the City the Lands and Waters lye ſo convenient, that it exceeds <hi>Haerlem;</hi> for <hi>Haerlem</hi> Lake lyeth but upon one Quarter of the Town, and the Waters lye at <hi>Coventry</hi> about three parts of that Town. And I am ſure <hi>Coventry</hi> ought to be the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place of this intended Linen Manufacture, and in few years would exceed <hi>Haerlem;</hi> God and Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fixed them right for it, both as to Land fit to bear Flax, good whitening, a large City in the very Centre of <hi>England,</hi> and their Woollen Manufacture being now wholly decayed. And in this City a Bank, by virtue of a voluntary Regiſter, is abſolutely neceſſary, and then the Gentlemen in the four Counties named may make their Sons Linen Merchants, and thereby be a means to help to beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> without fighting.</p>
               <p>I have been ſomething long upon this Theme, becauſe I hope and believe I may ſee ſomething of the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Linen Trade, come to paſs.</p>
               <p>But ſome other Queſtions will here be asked: As, who incouraged you to make this Diſcourſe of the Linen Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and who paid you for your pains in travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to find the things here writ? I anſwer, I was an Apprentice to a Linen Draper, and ſo I knew ſomething
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36927:45"/>of Linen; and finding the Poor unimployed, I with my Wife did promote the making of much fine Linen with good ſucceſs. And being employed and my Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges born by twelve Gentlemen of <hi>England,</hi> to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> a Manufacture out of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> made of Iron and Tin, there I did ſee what I here ſet down; and in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> I tryed and obſerved their way and manner of Trade in the Linen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: All which take you for nothing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Manufacture to be incouraged to ſet the poor people at work, being the growth and product of our own Kingdom, is that of Iron. But now I am ſure I ſhall draw a whole Swarm of Waſps about my Ears. For ſay ſome (and many too who think themſelves very wiſe) it were well if there were no Iron-works in <hi>England;</hi> and it was better when no Iron was made in <hi>England:</hi> and the Iron-works deſtroy all the Woods; and foreign Iron from <hi>Spain</hi> will do better and laſt longer. And I have heard many men both Rich and Sober often declare theſe things; and it hath been and is the opinion of nine parts of ten of the people of <hi>England,</hi> that it is ſo, and by no arguments whatever will they be beat from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it, although there is not one word true. As to the Firſt, The Iron works at preſent in <hi>England</hi> are of the ſame value, and I believe much more to the publick than the Woollen Manufacture is, and is the cauſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying near as many people, and much more Lands for Horſes and Oxen to carry and recarry thoſe heavy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of which the Iron is made, and the Iron, and the things made of the Iron. Therefore I will take the Kingdom half round, and ſhew you what the Iron works do contribute to the Publick and to the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:36927:45"/>
               <p>And Firſt, I will begin in <hi>Monmouth-ſhire,</hi> and go through the Foreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi> and there take notice what infinite quantities of Raw Iron is there made, with Bar Iron and Wire; and conſider the infinite number of Men, Horſes, and Carriages which are to ſupply theſe Works, and alſo digging of Iron Stone, providing of Cinders, carrying to the Works, making it into Sows and Bars, cutting of Wood, and converting it into Charcoal. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo in all theſe parts the Woods are not worth the cutting and bringing home by the Owner to burn in their Houſes: And it is becauſe in all theſe places there are Pit Coals very cheap. Conſider alſo the multitude of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and People thereabouts employed that make the Lands dear: And what with the benefit made of the Woods, and the People making the Land dear, it is not inferior for Riches to any place in <hi>England.</hi> And if theſe Advantages were not there, it would be little leſs than a howling Wilderneſs. I believe if this comes to the hands of Sir <hi>Baynom Frogmorton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Duncomb Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> they will be on my ſide. Moreover, there is yet a moſt great benefit to the Kingdom in general by the Sow Iron made of the Iron Stone and Roman Cinders in the Foreſt of <hi>Dean;</hi> for that Metal is of a moſt gentle, pliable, ſoft nature, eaſily and quickly to be wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Manufacture, over what any other Iron is, and it is the beſt in the known World: and the greateſt part of this Sow Iron is ſent up <hi>Severne</hi> to the Forges, into <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire, Shropſhire, Stafford-ſhire, Warwick-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and there it's made into Bar-Iron: And becauſe of its kind and gentle nature to work, it is now at <hi>Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Dudly, Wolverhampton, Sedgley, Waſall,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham,</hi> and thereabouts, wrought and manufactured into all ſmall Commodities, and diffuſed all <hi>England</hi> over,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36927:46"/>and thereby a great Trade made of it; and when manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured ſent into moſt parts of the World. And I can very eaſily make it appear, that in the Foreſt of <hi>Deane,</hi> and thereabouts, and about the Materials that come from thence, there are employed, and have their ſubſiſtence therefrom, no leſs than ſixty thouſand perſons. And certainly if this be true, then it is certain it is better theſe Iron-works were up and in being, than that there were none. And it were well if there were an Act of Parliament for incloſing all Commons fit or any way likely to bear Wood in the Foreſt of <hi>Deane,</hi> and ſix Miles round the Foreſt; and that great quantities of Timber might by the ſame Law be there preſerved, for to ſupply in future Ages Timber for Shipping and Building. And I dare ſay the Foreſt of <hi>Deane</hi> is, as to the Iron, to be compared to the Sheeps back, as to the Wollen: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being of more advantage to <hi>England</hi> than theſe two are. And if Woods are not preſerved in and near the Foreſt, to ſupply the Works for future Ages, that Trade will leſſen and dye, as to <hi>England,</hi> and betake her ſelf unto ſome other Nation or Country. And now in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire, Shropſhire, Stafford-ſhire, Warwick-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Derby-ſhire</hi> there are great and numerous quantities of Iron-works, and there much Iron is made of Metal or Iron Stone of another nature quite different from that of the Foreſt of <hi>Deane.</hi> This Iron is a ſhort ſoft Iron, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Cold-ſhore Iron, of which all the Nails are made, and infinite other Commodities: In which work are employed many more perſons, if not double to what are employed in the Foreſt of <hi>Deane.</hi> And in all thoſe Countries the Gentlemen and others have Moneys for their Woods at all times when they want it, which is to them a great benefit and advantage; and the Lands in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36927:46"/>moſt of theſe places are double the rate that they would be at if there were not Iron-works there. And in all theſe Countries now named there is an infinite of Pit Coals, and the Pit Coals being near the Iron, and the Iron Stone growing with the Coals, there it is manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured very cheap, and ſent all <hi>England</hi> over, and to moſt parts of the World. And if the Iron-works were not there, the Woods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all theſe Countries to the Owners thereof would not be worth the cutting and carrying home, becauſe of the cheapneſs of the Coals and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
               <p>I could ſay ſomething as to <hi>Notingham</hi> and <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex;</hi> but I leave that to ſome other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en that knows the Countries better than I do. And in theſe Countries now mentioned there are many and vaſt Commons, very natural and fit to bear Wood, which at preſent are of very little uſe to the publick. And for that in theſe parts there never will be any want of Pit Coals, to work and manufacture the Iron when once made into Bars, but Woods do much decay; and this being a thing of ſuch great benefit to the publick, and in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Poor at work; it were well that a Law might paſs for incloſing all Commons fit and apt to bear wood, which are and lye within twelve Miles of the Town of <hi>Sturbridge</hi> in the County of <hi>Worceſter;</hi> and that in ſuch incloſed Copices there may be proviſion made to preſerve Timber, now much wanting in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>The next Objection is, That it was better when there was no Iron made in <hi>England;</hi> But when that was, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I nor the Objector knows. For in the Foreſt of <hi>Deane</hi> and thereabouts the Iron is made at this day of Cinders, being the rough and offal thrown by in the <hi>Romans</hi> time; they then having only foot-blaſts to melt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36927:47"/>the Iron Stone, but now by the force of a great Wheel that drives a pair of Bellows twenty foot long, all that Iron is extracted out of the Cinders which could not be forced from it by the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot-blaſt. And in the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>Deane</hi> and thereabouts, and as high as <hi>Worceſter,</hi> there are great and infinite quantities of theſe Cinders; ſome in vaſt Mounts above ground, ſome under ground, which will ſupply the Iron-works ſome hundreds of years, and theſe Cinders are they which make the prime and beſt Iron, and with much leſs Charcoal than doth the Iron Stone. And certainly this being ſo, it will be great policy for the Government timely to conſider and weigh the great benefit Iron-works are to theſe pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> and to the Kingdom and People in general; and therefore to begin to countenance them, in preſerving Woods for their continuation and duration.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, Iron-works deſtroy the Woods and Timber. I affirm the contrary; and that Iron-works are ſo far from the deſtroying of Woods and Timber, that they are the occaſion of the increaſe thereof. For in all parts where Iron-works are, there generally are great quantities of Pit Coals very cheap, and in theſe places there are great quantities of Copices or Woods which ſupply the Iron-works: And if the Iron-works were not in being, theſe Copices would have been ſtocked up, and turned into Paſture and Tillage, as is now daily done in <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> where the Iron-works, or moſt of them, are laid down. And in <hi>Gloceſter-ſhire, Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Warwick, Salop,</hi> and <hi>Stafford</hi> Shires are vaſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite quantities of Copices, wherein there are great ſtore of young Timber growing; and if it were not that there could be Moneys had for theſe Woods by the Owners from the Iron Maſters, all theſe Copices would be ſtocked
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36927:47"/>up, and turned into Tillage and Paſture, and ſo there would be neither Woods nor Timber in theſe places: And the Reaſon is, Pit Coal in all theſe places, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duration and cheapneſs thereof, is not ſo chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Owner of the Woods as cutting and carrying the Woods home to his Houſe. And as to making Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal with Timber in thoſe parts, ſo much talked of, it was and is moſt notoriouſly falſe; for Timber in all theſe parts is worth thirty ſhillings a Tun, and a Tun and three quarters of Timber will but make one Coard of Wood. So let all rational men conſider, whether an Iron Maſter will cut up Timber to the value of fifty ſhillings, to make one Coard of Wood, when he pays for his Wood in moſt of theſe places but ſeven ſhillings a Coard?</p>
               <p>Now I have ſhewed you the two Manufactures of Linen and Iron with the product thereof, and all the materials are with us growing; and theſe two Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures will if by Law countenanced ſet all the poor in <hi>England</hi> at work, and much inrich the Country, and thereby fetch people into the Kingdom, whereas now they depart; and thereby deprive the <hi>Dutch</hi> of theſe two great Manufactures of Iron and Linen: I mean Iron wrought into all Commodities, ſo vaſtly brought down the <hi>Rhine</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi> from <hi>Leige, Gluke, Soley</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> and by them diffuſed and ſent all the World over. And theſe two Trades being well fixed here, will help to beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> without fighting. I pray conſider the charge <hi>England</hi> is now at with the poor, and obſerve what they now coſt the Publick; but if imployed in theſe two Manufactures, what advance by their Labour might the publick receive? Admit there be in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> a hundred thouſand poor people unimployed, and each one coſts the publick four pence the Day in food, and if
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36927:48"/>theſe were imployed they would earn eight pence the day; and ſo the publick in what might be gained and ſaved will advance twelve pence the day by each poor perſon now unimployed. So a hundred thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will be to the benefit of the publick if imployed, one Million and a half yearly in theſe two Manufactures of Iron and Linen. And as theſe two Manufactures are now managed in <hi>Saxony,</hi> they ſet all their poor at work, I travelling aworter and a-croſs <hi>Saxony</hi> did not ſee one beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger there; and theſe two Manufactures being prudently, and by good Laws there ſupported and encouraged, they are become two parts in three of the Revenue and benefit of that Duke, and they are ſent into <hi>England</hi> at this time in great quantities, all paying Cuſtoms in ten ſeveral places before they come here.</p>
               <p>And that the Linen and Iron Manufactures may be ſo incouraged here by a publick Law, as that we may draw theſe Trades ſolely to us, which now foreign Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit of, there ought in the firſt place to be a Tax or Cuſtom at leaſt of four ſhillings in the pound put on all Linen Yarn, Threads, Tapes and Twines for Cordage that ſhall be imported into <hi>England,</hi> and three ſhillings in the pound upon all Linen Clothes under four ſhillings the Ell; and this Law to be and continue for ſeven years. And by vertue of this Tax or Impoſition there will be ſuch advantage given to the Linen Manufacture in its Infancy, that thereby it will take deep rooting and get a good Foundation on a ſudden, (the conſequence whereof will do and bring to paſs the great things formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.)</p>
               <p>And as to the Incouragement of the Iron, and Iron Manufactures, there ſhould be three pound a Tun Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, laid on all foreign Barr Iron imported, and ſix
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36927:48"/>pounds the Tun on all the Manufactured Iron imported into <hi>England;</hi> and by theſe two ways, namely by a Tax being laid upon the imported Barr Iron, Iron Wares, and Thread, Tape, Twine, and Linen Cloth of all ſorts, all the Trade of theſe things will be here, and all the Poor ſet at work, the <hi>Dutch</hi> robbed of one of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Flowers, and to the King and people in general at leaſt ſix Millions a year advantage. The reaſons how and upon what grounds it will be ſo; as alſo the reaſons why the Commons in the Countries afore mentioned ought to be incloſed for Wood and Timber, you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the ſecond part.</p>
               <p>But I know there will be a parcel of at leaſt eight Anchor Smiths near <hi>London</hi> that will make a great Noiſe againſt laying a Tax upon foreign Iron, and give many wiſe reaſons for it, and at laſt endeavour to knock all on the head, urging that it will be of great prejudice to the King, for it will cauſe him to pay dear for all his Iron that ſhall be made uſe of for his Naval Force. But the King need not fear that, for he may if he pleaſe have ſufficient of his own at half the rates he pays now for it, (and good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities to ſell to others) and made at the place before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned near <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire.</hi> But there is ſomething that may be of worſe conſequence than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, if the Iron Manufacture be not incouraged. At preſent moſt of the Works in <hi>Suſſex</hi> and <hi>Surry</hi> are laid down, and many in the North of <hi>England,</hi> and many in other parts muſt follow, if not prevented by incloſing Commons to ſupply them with Wood. And when the greateſt part of the Iron-works are aſleep, if there ſhould be occaſion for great quantities of Guns and Bullet, and other ſorts of Iron Commodities for a preſent unexpected War, and the <hi>Sound</hi> happen to be lockt up, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36927:49"/>Iron coming to us; truly we ſhould then be in a fine caſe! Therefore if the Iron Deſign at <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> go on, it may do well; for Store will be no ſore.</p>
               <p>I hope now I have plainly made it appear, that by the two Manufactures of Iron and Linen, being incouraged as is ſet down, all the poor People of <hi>England</hi> may be ſet at work.</p>

               <p>Theſe things being made and done, then the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel hath a Place on the top of the higheſt Steeple whereby he may look all over the Town; one is by Day, the other by Night; and every two Hours in the Night he plays half an hour upon a Flagelet, being very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36927:57"/>delightful in the Night: and he looks round the City; if he obſerves any Smoak or Fire or danger of Fire, he preſently ſounds a Trumpet and hangs out a bloody Flag, towards that Quarter of the City where the Fire is. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all the people which are for the quenching of the Fires, with the Commiſſioners and Engineers, or as many as are in Town, run to the place; and preſently the Commiſſioners or any two of them with the Engineers give the neceſſary orders for the ſuppreſſing of the Fire, either by pulling down or blowing up the Houſes. All the Labourers obey in aſſiſting to pull down, carrying the goods that muſt be removed to the Houſes appointed, fetching the Water being ready filled in Copper Tubs upon Sleds which is quickly done, for that the Sleds, Tubs and Water with the place where they ſtand are order'd ſo, a Horſe may come at them; and there are two Cocks to ſupply with Water, one upon the one ſide of the ſpace where the Tubs are, and the other on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide: ſo the Empty Tubs are filled as they return, whereby no Water can be wanting.

And if this prevention, Rule and Order were not, it's impoſſible but upon the breaking out of Fire the greateſt part of the Cities would be deſtroyed; for that many Cities are built of Fir, which is very full of Turpentine. Now with us in <hi>England</hi> upon the breaking out of great Fires, all the Rable runs crying Fire, Fire, to the great affrightment and amazement of moſt people near where the Fire is, and makes it worſe than really it is, which cauſeth the remove of goods to their great loſs and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, theſe ſorts of ſudden Frights coſt many Poor Women their Lives; and ſometimes it goeth near the Man too. And another ſort of people run to Rob and Steal, and it's feared to increaſe the Fires into the Bargain, that they may better bring to paſs their wicked ends. Then one cries, Pull down, and another cries, Blow up this Houſe, another cries, Blow up that Houſe. So grows a confuſion not to be parallel'd. One ſtands in the way of another. Many Poor Souls do their beſt to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36927:58"/>prevent the ſpreading abroad of the Fire, and for want of Judgment are many times deſtroyed. Then comes ſome perſon in Authority or other and he cries, Fetch Powder to blow up this Houſe or that Houſe; and no Powder at preſent is to be had; at laſt when the Fire hath got great head, then the Powder comes; Blow up this Houſe, ſaith the Gentleman, the multitude cry, no, no, Blow up that Houſe. There they are as it were at the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> all in confuſion. But pray you write by this copy here ſet you, and then the Fires may be prevented, the peoples fears allay'd and their minds quieted, the great and miſerable Calamities that Fires occaſion, prevented, and all people lye quiet in their Beds except thoſe imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And then in ſuch a great City as <hi>London</hi> is, many Fires would be over and quenched, before the twentieth part of the people in the City did know there were any Fire at all. And certainly if ever ſuch a thing as this take place, it is high time now it were done. I have here annexed the Houſes built, Tubs upon the Sleds, and if you would have me to do more, I cannot. Only I can tell you for <hi>London</hi> and the Suburbs this Rule would do well in three places; <hi>Viz.</hi> in St. <hi>Martins</hi> Steeple in the Fields one Sentinel, in St. <hi>Sepulchres</hi> Steeple another, and in the Monument another. And all things done as is here preſcribed, your fears would be quickly gone, the Houſes would raiſe Rents, and men would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Houſes that would now ſell thoſe they have if they could.</p>

                  <speaker>Cl.</speaker>
                  <p>It is <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> where they make the Stuffs for Hangings.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
                  <p>I know the Factors that belong to that Town, they are very honeſt men, and will not do any ſuch thing.</p>

                  <p>It is true what I ſay, for lately ſome friends of the Clothiers of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> and ſome Upholſterers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted how to bring the <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> Trade to be good to both, it being a Trade that is much debaſed and ſpoiled by the Factors; and having brought it near to paſs, the beſt of the Factors ſent Letters to the Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and acquaints them, that the Stuffs may be made elſewhere as well as there, (and much more) which did ſo affright the Clothiers, that they durſt not agree to fix their Trade in two hands, although it might have been Five or ſix thouſand pounds a year in the Trades way.</p>

                  <p>Yes, all the Town will tell you it is ſo; and I can bring you to a Man in <hi>London,</hi> can tell you the whole Story, who treated the Upholſterers, and got two Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to lend the Trade Five or ſix thouſand pounds to help to drive the Trade, that ſo it might be done with profit and eaſe.</p>

                  <p>Well, old Friend, I do believe you; for <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:36927:62"/>Factors have ſpoiled the Weavers and the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſterers Trade, as our <hi>Blackwell-hall</hi> Factors, Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Drawers, have ſpoiled your Trade and ours.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Cl.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, <hi>Sir,</hi> it is even ſo: and what can ſuch a one as I do, ſeeing a whole Town ſtand in fear of Three or four Factors?</p>

                  <p>Friend, you know when you and I dealt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt, when <hi>I. A.</hi> was a good Clothier, and <hi>I.</hi> of <hi>Leck</hi> a good Wool-man, it was not ſo; then the Factors were your Servants, and the Packers and Drawers were ours: Will you Clothiers joyn with us Drapers, to ſee if we can reduce the Trade to the old good condition it was in formerly?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>I will with all my heart, and ſo will all the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers in our Country too; I will undertake for them: for we are almoſt at Beggars-buſh, and we cannot tell how to help our ſelves: And our Trade grows worſe and worſe, we make no profit of our Commodities.</p>

                  <p>Friend, Now I ſee this Country-man was near the mark; and I will even burn my Loom and Beam too, for I ſee all the World are mad. Here is the Moneys gone (and taken out of Trade in <hi>England</hi>) and carried into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and our People too, with this Money, make Cloth, and ſerve it cheap in all places where we ſend our Cloth; and carry to <hi>Holland</hi> cheap Wool, and cheap Victuals, and pay the Moneys back again in Four years: I will go to <hi>London,</hi> and tell my Lord Mayor of this fine Jig, let who will go to <hi>Salisbury</hi> for me.</p>

The Pattern of the Wind-Mill for thickning fine Clothes, is taken from the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Harlem</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> the Pattern of the Mill in a Barge to thicken and ſcour courſe Clothes, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from one upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> near the Bridg at <hi>Draiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in <hi>Saxony.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, I will acquaint you with all particulars, and then I will give you afterward, the deſcription of the Mill in the Barge, and the Mill that goeth by Wind.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36927:66"/>At <hi>Harlem</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> they have Windmills to thicken and ſcour their fine and <hi>ſuper</hi>-fine clothes, built cloſe by the City-ſide; the Mill is are made in all points, as the Saw-Windmill on the <hi>Bank-ſide</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> over-againſt the <hi>Savoy;</hi> and it turns round, that is, the whole Fabrick turns; whereby it catches the Wind at all points: And there are Six or Eight Fallers (or Feet) which are taken and lifted up by the Axle-tree, which the Fanns are faſtned in, and ſo fall down-right into a Box, or Cheſt, wherein the Cloth lyeth; and the Cheſt is ſo made and ordered, and the Fallers ſo fitted, that the Cloth turns round in the Cheſt, and the Square or hole the Faller drops into, is ſo curiouſly and cloſe made, that a Man cannot get his Knife into the Cheſt betwixt the Wood and the Faller; and all other parts of the Trough and Cheſt where the Cloth lyeth, is made cloſe and tite, and thereby the Wind and Air is kept from coming into the Cheſt when the Cloth is thickning; and in caſe the Wind ceaſes blowing, they do either take the Cloth out of the Cheſt, and lay it on drift, whereby it takes no harm; or elſe keep it cloſe in the Cheſt, that no Air can come to it: But the Mills are ſo ordered, that they are made to ſcour more Clothes than they thicken; and if the Wind ceaſes, they let the Fallers that are to ſcour, ſtand ſtill: And for Water, it is pumpt up by force of the Wind to a good height, and ſo conveyed into the Cheſt, to the Cloths, by little Spouts, as there is occaſion. In <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> near <hi>Poland,</hi> by reaſon of the dryneſs of the Countrey, and ſmallneſs of the Rains, in Summer-time moſt Rivers are much wanting in Water; Therefore the Mills for grinding of Corn, and thickning of Clothes, are made and fixt in Barges, upon the <hi>Elbe</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:36927:67"/>near ſome Bridg (or in a quick ſtream); And near the Bridg at <hi>Draiſden</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> there they ſcour and thicken their Clothes in Barges; the Mill is fixed in a Barge, and in ſome Barges are Two Mills. Obſerve the Pattern, and I will ſave my labour of Writing; for by it you will ſee how it is in every particular.</p>

Well, if I ſee you at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> you ſhall be made Free of that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, and pay nothing, and Dine with our Biſhop too, for he loves all thoſe things we have ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of.</p>

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:36927:69"/>you how the Trick is: And if I had not been an old Clothier, and a Fulling-Boy when I was young, I could not have learnt it out. And it is ſure, our Fulling-Mills that we now have, our Fallers are taken up a great height, and ſo fall down into the Stock upon the Cloth, and in its quick motion down, it contracts Wind, and brings it down with it into the Stock where the Cloth is, and ſo the Wind and the Air being forced upon the Cloth, makes it hard, and cools it; and the Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open, and the Cloth in it turning round in the Stock, doth alſo by the Wind and the Air it attracts, help to cool and harden the Cloth; whereas the Mills that go by Wind, the Fallers, or Feet, fall down perpendicular into the Stock, through a ſquare hole, where the Cloth is, and ſo attracts no Wind, nor can any Air get into the Stock or Cheſt where the Cloth is; and therefore the Cloth is always kept in a conſtant heat and temper, which muſt of neceſſity bring it to good proof, and make it look very fine, and feel very ſoft. I am reſolved, now I have got this knack, I'le pay the Reckoning.</p>

                  <p>Another trick there is, of carrying Fullers-earth from <hi>Woborne</hi> to <hi>Lynn</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> as they pretend; and then Ship it to be carried to the Clothiers in the Weſt: And when at Sea, a Weſt-wind blows the Ship into <hi>Fluſhing</hi> in <hi>Zealand.</hi> And we will have more Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers-earth carried from <hi>Arundel</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> or to <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and there Ship'd, to ſecure the Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the North of <hi>England:</hi> And when that Ship is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt <hi>Hull,</hi> a Weſt-wind ſhall blow her over to the <hi>Brill,</hi> or into the <hi>Texel,</hi> into <hi>Holland.</hi> And theſe two Ladings of Earth, with a little that ſhall be brought over for Ballaſt for Ships, will do miſchief enough: For Trade will go where it is moſt encouraged, and where the Merchant and Clothier can get moſt by it.</p>

                  <p>True, old Friend, theſe tricks there are, and there are bad men enough, that will be apt enough to leave the Land where they were born; but let us ſee to help theſe matters: For if you ſhould be one of them, all the Poor of the Countrey will be bound to curſe you, and ſo will the Rich too; for we have had men bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of our own Trade (but it will not become me to name Perſons), who have provoked many Clothiers to ſell their eſtates, and Tranſport themſelves into the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and there ſet up the Clothing-Trade, which hath already quite ſpoiled our Courſe-Cloth-Trade Eaſtward, and the Trade at <hi>Hamborough</hi> too; for if their Trade be ſpoil'd in <hi>England,</hi> they muſt try if they can make it out ſomewhere elſe; as in <hi>Ireland, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Well Friend, for the concluſion of this Diſcourſe, we have no more to do, but to endeavour the redreſs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36927:71"/>of theſe grievances, as far as in duty we may; and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to repreſent to Authority the great advantage it may be to the publick to prevent the carrying of Fullers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earth out of the Land: To provide that all Factors, Packers, and Drawers, may be put in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; That the illegal Tranſportation of Wools may be hindred, and the Trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> regulated: It would be of great eaſe and advantage, if our Weſtern Clothes might be Tranſported from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> beyond the Seas, to ſave the charge of carrying them to <hi>London.</hi> Many other particulars might be added, but this for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, till we meet next.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>NOW I have diſcovered to you the way, manner, and method of ſetting all the Poor in <hi>England</hi> at work, with the growth and product of our own Nation; with the particular means for bringing the ſame to paſs; And Places aſſigned for the doing thereof; with the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and conveniences that are by God and Nature fixt in theſe Counties. Next, I will ſhew you, That by the means and ways hereafter preſcribed, all the poor people that are imployed in theſe Manufactures, ſhall be in the ſame Counties fed with Bread ſufficient, without any charge to the Publick; and thereby the Commodities will be Manufactured cheap. The like benefit and advantage, infinite of the poor People of <hi>England</hi> in other parts will receive, by the way here-after ſet down, taken exactly from the ſame things done in other places; whereby they work cheap, and ſend infinite of their Manufactured Commodities into many parts of the World: And were they not fixt in theſe places beyond the Seas, in thoſe Manufactures and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36927:72"/>the Princes of thoſe Countries, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would be ſtrangely poor.</p>
               <p>My deſign now is, to ſpeak of Granaries to hold Corn, and to be fill'd in the time of plenty; and the advantage they are of, being well fixt in convenient places (with the benefit the Poor will receive by them, and the Rich alſo): And where ever Trade and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture is intended to be ſet on foot, ſo as to bring it to perfection, Granaries muſt be made, and built in places convenient, to anſwer the ends deſigned.</p>
               <p>The Great Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> hath three great Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; one of Iron, Tinn and Copper; another of Linnen, and ſpun Threds of all ſorts; the third of Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Timbers of all ſorts: He hath convenienced them thus; As to his Iron, Tinn, and Copper, he hath fixt theſe works in the Valley, running from <hi>Segar-hutton,</hi> clear a-long by the Cities of <hi>Anaburgh, Sneburgh,</hi> and <hi>Mareauburgh,</hi> and down as far as <hi>Awe;</hi> and in the Hills and Mountains are his Minerals: In the Valleys are the Rivers, whereon are ſet the Works. The Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and at leaſt Ten Miles round, are full of Woods to ſupply his Works; not one Acre of common-Land lyes waſte: At the deſcent of the Hills, are infinite of Saw-Mills that go by Water, which Saw all manner of Firr and Oak; and in the Summer-time it is dragged to the River <hi>Elb,</hi> and ſo ſent down to <hi>Hamborough.</hi> And things being thus fixt, with all advantages that Trade can deſire, that Place is ſtrangely populous, and vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rich, and yields to the Duke a great Revenue: And it lies as <hi>Wales,</hi> and as the Foreſt of <hi>Dean</hi> doth to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next to theſe Wood-land Countries, lies the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Plain Countrey, wherein is the famous City of <hi>Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:36927:72"/>very Rich in Corn and Flax; and ſo it holds to <hi>Dreſden</hi> upon the Left-hand of <hi>Myſon,</hi> with ſome Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards: And in theſe delightful Countries, there is no waſte Lands, but all under improvement. In all the great Towns, there are great Granaries for Corn; and in the Time of Plenty, they lay up for a Rainy-day: And ſo there is ſufficient for the Poor at eaſie rates at all times; whereby the Manufacture is always cheaply done, and thereby hath the advantage of ſending it to foreign Markets, and under-ſell others.</p>
               <p>The next Country joyning to <hi>Saxony,</hi> is the Prince of <hi>Hainaults,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Parmburghs,</hi> with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Hall;</hi> wherein ſtands the Cities of <hi>Salts, Wadell, Shenibank,</hi> and that brave old City of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi> (deſtroyed by Fire and Sword by Count <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>): Theſe Countreys for Corn, as to Rye and Wheat, are ſo plentiful, that no part of <hi>Europe</hi> can go before them, there being much Corn to ſpare: In the Two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Shenibank</hi> and <hi>Magdenburgh,</hi> are many Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they lying upon the ſide of the <hi>Elbe:</hi> And in the City of <hi>Magdenburgh,</hi> I was credibly informed (being Twice in that City), that there were Three hundred Granaries of all ſorts; wherein Corn is kept ſweet, and ſafe from vermin, to admiration. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Granaries built, with the way of ordering of the Corn, and the benefit which is received thereby, you ſhall have, when I ſpeak of Granaries ſetting up in <hi>England.</hi> From hence the <hi>Brunſwick</hi> People fetch their Wheat they make there Mum of; and down the <hi>Elb</hi> to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> is ſent infinite of Corn out of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries; and from thence to all parts that ſtand in need thereof: In theſe Countreys there is very little Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, only ſome courſe Linnen, and Linnen-yarn:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36927:73"/>Theſe Granaries preſerve the Corn Six, Eight, or Ten years, as good and ſweet as when it was firſt put in: There are great Merchants for Corn, and the Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers lay up their Corn at eaſie Rates, and ſo have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Straw yearly, and not Rick it up, as we do in <hi>England,</hi> to be devoured by Rats and Mice. There, Men and Maid-ſervants, and all other perſons that have Monies, buy Corn when it is cheap, and lay it up till it be dear: And in theſe publick Granaries, the Corn is kept ſafe, ſweet, and well, a whole year, for a Half-peny a Buſhel; and the Granary-Man gets by it. The like may be done in <hi>England;</hi> and that which now feeds Rats and Mice, and otherways conſumed, will ſupply the greateſt part of the poor People of <hi>England</hi> with Bread, being preſerved in Granaries.</p>
               <p>Now I am for ſaving the Corn in <hi>England,</hi> and keeping it ſafe and ſweet in Granaries (which is conſumed at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by Rats and Mice) until there ſhall be want and neceſſity for it to be delivered to the Poor: In the Four Counties I name for the Linnen Manufacture, <hi>Oxford, Warwick, Leiceſter,</hi> and <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> there ought to be Granaries to lay up Corn; theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being great Corn-Counties: And at the head of the Navigable Rivers, are the places fit for ſuch Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries; and firſt <hi>Wellinborough</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> or thereabouts. Secondly, ſome Town in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> within Four Miles of Kings-Mills; unto which Place <hi>Trent</hi> is Navigable. Thirdly, <hi>Banbury,</hi> if the River <hi>Sharwell</hi> be made Navigable to <hi>Banbury;</hi> or elſe about <hi>Bleckington,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Angleſes</hi> Land, near <hi>Anſlo</hi>-Bridg. And fifthly, <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> If Granaries were built in thoſe Places, to hold Corn there, it would be brought in with eaſe; and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36927:73"/>when want and ſcarcity of Corn comes, it is then ready to be ſent down the Navigable Rivers, or to be diſperſt for the benefit of the Poor in the Countrey. <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> is abounding in Corn, and when plenty there, it is very cheap, having no Navigable River near to carry it away; the like is <hi>Northamptonſhire:</hi> But if Granaries were well ſetled in theſe Places near <hi>Trent,</hi> and St. <hi>Ives</hi> River then it is ready for a Market, when it offers it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lechload,</hi> at the Head of the River <hi>Iſis,</hi> Ten Miles above <hi>Oxford,</hi> will be a very fit place for a Granary; for in thither will come great quantities of Corn out of <hi>Oxford, Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>Berkshire:</hi> And there it will be ready upon all occaſions, when wanted, either for the Poor, or to be tranſported down the River to <hi>London,</hi> and other parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> will be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good place to build Granaries to receive Corn; and I will affirm, if there were Three or Four large Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries built in the Lands of Sir <hi>John Clapton,</hi> near the Bridg at <hi>Stratford,</hi> and well managed for the good of the Poor, and Linnen Trade; That on that ſide the River, there would be in a very ſhort time as great a Town built, as <hi>Stratford</hi> now is; and there have as great a Trade as any City in thoſe parts of <hi>England</hi> (<hi>Briſtol</hi> only excepted): And theſe are my Reaſons: Firſt, the River <hi>Avon</hi> being made Navigable to <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Barges that come up with Coles, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods; by them, Corn will be taken back to <hi>Bristol,</hi> and up the River <hi>Severn,</hi> as far as the <hi>Welſh</hi>-Pool. And Secondly, the Country near <hi>Stratford,</hi> as far as <hi>Banbury, Ayno-Dedinton, Biſter,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Brak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and round ot <hi>Daventry,</hi> is very full, and abounds
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36927:74"/>with good Corn; and the Carts that come to <hi>Stratford</hi> for Coles, would never come empty down, but bring Corn with them, if there were Granaries ſufficient to receive it: So you ſee all things would be fitted for ſore and back carriage: And I will affirm, No place in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can expect the benefit or advantage by any ſuch Granaries, as <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon</hi> may; for that great and vaſt quantities of Corn is raiſed in thoſe parts, and when cheap, they cannot tell what to do with it, the ways being ſo dirty and deep. But the advantage of the Navigation will ſend it to ſerve <hi>Somerſetſhire, Wales, Shropſhire, Cheſhire,</hi> and other parts, in wet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable years.</p>
               <p>But the third and great Reaſon why this place ſhall exceed all others in <hi>England,</hi> is this, There may as much Mum be made there, as at preſent is made at <hi>Brunſwick:</hi> And there Mum may be made and ſent into <hi>Ireland, Weſt-Indies, France, Spain,</hi> and into the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> And theſe Granaries will be the occaſion of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away the Mum-Trade from <hi>Brunſwick:</hi> This ſhews as like a <hi>Romance</hi> as doth the Title-page of my Book, unleſs I do give you reaſons for what I ſay, and ſhew you how it may be brought to paſs, the which I will do: Obſerve, the Mum at <hi>Brunſwick</hi> is made of Wheat and the Wheat that it is made of, is brought from the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries at <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> and <hi>Shenibank,</hi> and it grows in the Vale of <hi>Parinburg;</hi> when it comes to <hi>Brunſwick</hi> it is Malted, and ſo made into Mum; and when made, then ſent by Land to the River <hi>Elb,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough:</hi> and from thence diſpoſed by Merchants unto all Parts: But the Mum at <hi>Brunſwick</hi> is a Medicine, and drinks very nauſeous, and is not there drinkable at all; but that which makes it good, palitable, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36927:74"/>ſtrong, is its being long at Sea; There it is forc'd into a fermentation, and that keeps it working, whereby it alters the very property of the Liquor; and were it not to be ſent to Sea, that Trade at <hi>Brunſwick</hi> would not be worth any thing; and to convince you further of the reaſon of what I ſay, take this one thing, and that will confirm you in the Truth of the reſt. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beer Brewed at <hi>London,</hi> and carried to Sea, and Landed at <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and ſo carried up the <hi>Elb,</hi> as far as <hi>Draiſden,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi>'s Court, and in thoſe Parts, it is ſold for Six pence a Quart; and it is not like the Beer either for Taſt, Strength, or Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it was when here; the Sea having put it into a fermentation, cauſeth it to drink pleaſant, ſtrong, and delightful, even comparable to <hi>March</hi>-Beer in <hi>England</hi> four Years old, which is well-brewed, and grown very Mellow; Hundreds of Merchants can affirm what I ſay to be true. Now I will ſhew you the reaſons why the <hi>Brunſwick</hi>-Trade will come to <hi>Stratford</hi> in courſe; and when I have Publiſhed theſe reaſons now given in Print, the Trade of making Mum will begin in ſome ſhort time to be ſet forward there; and that River being a Brat of my Brain, when I contriv'd it, the Trade of making Mum there, was a thing I much hoped to ſee come to paſs; and I believe it is now not far off. And therefore I beg that worthy Gentlemans leave, Sir <hi>John Clapton,</hi> that I may give Name unto a Town that will certainly riſe and be built in about thirty Acres of his Land near <hi>Stratford-Bridg,</hi> wherein Granaries, Mum, and other <hi>Brew-houſes</hi> will be built, as alſo ſome part of the Linnen-Trade there Manufactured: The place being ſo conveniently ſcituated, that Cuts may be made in the Land for Barges to come and go to each Back-ſide,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36927:75"/>thereby to unlade all goods with eaſe, and little charge; And I name that Town, whereof ſome part is now built, New-<hi>Brunſwick;</hi> for in <hi>Brunſwick</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> the Trade is Mum, Linnen, and Linnen-Yarn; and I hope to ſee before I die, as much Monies turned and wound in Mum, Linnen, Linnen-Yarn at New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> near <hi>Stratford-Bridg,</hi> as is now at <hi>Brunſwick</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> Now I will demonſtrate. and ſhew you the reaſons, and how eaſie it is to bring the Mum-Trade to New-<hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</hi> New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> lies at the Head of a Navigable River, and within twenty Miles round there is as good Wheat as any is in <hi>England</hi> (and I think the beſt), and always the cheapeſt, the place is well ſcituated for that purpoſe; and all materials are ready at hand. The Wheat in theſe Parts is a much better Corn, than is the VVheat at <hi>Brunſwick;</hi> for the VVheat at <hi>Brunſwick</hi> is a flat ſmall VVheat, and thick Husked; the reaſon of that is, the Climate where it grows; the Sun is very hot in the two Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and ſo the heat of the Sun doth not give it leave to fill and ripen kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Our VVheat is large, full-breſted, and thin-rined, and none in <hi>England</hi> to compare with the VVheat near <hi>Banbury,</hi> and upon the Hills thereabouts. Now at New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> build <hi>Granaries,</hi> and take in VVheat when it is cheap, as it will be this Year: and write by the Copy of the <hi>Granaries</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and then the Mum-Brewers at New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> will have the ſame advantage, nay, and much better than the Mum-Brewers have at Old <hi>Brunſwick;</hi> for at New <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> there Granaries will be in the Town where they Brew, and better Corn, and at the Head of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable River, to be tranſported down to Sea, and ſo for any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> without paying ſo many Cuſtoms
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36927:75"/>and Taxes, as doth Old-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> for their Mum. Alſo the Wheat is much better, and no Land-carriage for the commodity; and at New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> are Coles to be had cheap and plentiful to maintain the Fire; whereas at Old-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> VVood is dear, and very charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>From New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> Mum will be carried down the River <hi>Avon,</hi> into <hi>Severn,</hi> and ſo into <hi>King-Road,</hi> and there Shipt for <hi>London:</hi> And the charge of carriadge will be but twenty Shillings <hi>Per</hi> Tun to <hi>London;</hi> from New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> will be ſent down vaſt quantities of Mum, and ſold to the Merchants of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and by them ſent and diffuſed into all Parts; and then <hi>Briſtol</hi> will be unto New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> as <hi>Hamborough</hi> now is to Old-<hi>Brunſwick;</hi> for Trade will go and creep into any part where it can be beſt and cheapeſt done. And I ſay New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> conſidering all circumſtances, will make the Mum cheaper by four Shillings in the pound, than Old-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> can: But I know ſome will object, and ſay, that it hath been tried here ſeveral times to make Mum (and it will not be ſo good as the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Mum): My anſwer is, That the Sea is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of its being ſo good, it puts it to a ſecond work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Fermentation, which is the abſolute cauſe.</p>
               <p>But New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> will have a better advantage by Sea, than hath the Old; for the Mum being ſent down the River, and Shipt for <hi>London,</hi> and carried about the Lands-end, and ſo up the Channel to <hi>London,</hi> will have much more tumbling at Sea; and be commonly thrice as long coming about for <hi>London,</hi> as they are coming from <hi>Hamborough</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> one Wind ſerves from <hi>Hamborough</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> Five or Six ſeveral Winds will but ſerve to fit a Veſſel to come out of <hi>King-Road</hi> to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36927:76"/>
                  <hi>London.</hi> So you ſee New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> will have a better and more large paſſage at Sea, than from <hi>Hamborough</hi> to <hi>London:</hi> and then all Mum ſent to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> will by the Merchants be ſent to Sea; and the Sea will give it the advantage of a Fermentation. And in the Weſtern-Seas, it will do much more to benefit the Mum, than in the Eaſtern. In the Eaſtern-Seas, the Climate is cool un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>May;</hi> but in the Weſtern-Seas the Climate is warm in <hi>March:</hi> and as the different heat of the Climate is ſo the Liquor ſhall ripen and grow quick and fit to drink: And in that particular, New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> will infinitely out-do Old-<hi>Brunſwick;</hi> But if there be not Granaries built at New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> to take in Wheat when cheap, and all other things well ſetled, the benefit propoſed, muſt not be expected; for it muſt be made of cheap Wheat, and ſuch Wheat for a Stock muſt be taken into the Granaries in a cheap time; and when it is cheap, at leaſt, three years Wheat Malted before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand fit to make Mum. The older the Wheaten-Malt is for that purpoſe, the better it will be; and the more profit will be made of it. Now I leave this to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of that worthy Perſon Sir <hi>John Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in whoſe Lands New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> will be built; As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Mr. <hi>Briſhop,</hi> and my Friend the Town-Clerk of <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider what a great thing it will be to the Publique, and to the Countrey near <hi>Stratford,</hi> if the Linnen and Mum-Trade be ſetled there. No part in <hi>Europe</hi> is comparable, as to ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, materials, and ſoil to that place. And you may obſerve me in my whole Diſcourſe now Printed, that I ſhew you, that Trade will go to the place where it can be made cheapeſt, and ſooneſt at Market. For you may obſerve my Maxim, Honour and Honeſty
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36927:76"/>brings Riches: And theſe three bring Strength and Trade. So places made by Art convenient, as there is by <hi>Avon</hi> being made Navigable, gives the advantage to this great and rich deſign of ſetting forward the Mum and Linnen-Trade at New-<hi>Brunſwick.</hi> I pray obſerve; before you had that River Navigable, you were lockt up in the <hi>Inlands,</hi> and could not come to any Navigable River under twenty Miles; And in all times when Corn was plenty, the ways being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep in VVinter, and in ſome Summers it was there very cheap; whereby the Tenants could not pay Rents to the Landlords, and the Lands put to keep Sheep: So all improvements were wholly out of their Power. But ſee now how the caſe is altered, by this new River coming to your Town. Now all Improvements offer themſelves to you; as the Mum-Trade, the Linnen, and Thred-Trade: Nay you will be to the Weſt of <hi>England, Wales, Shropſhire,</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> as <hi>Dantzick</hi> is to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> you will ſerve all thoſe Parts, when Corn is wanting; you have the advantage of your Navigable River to ſend down your Corn, and ſo by the help of <hi>Severn</hi> it will be carried into all Parts that ſtand in need thereof.</p>
               <p>At New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> Granaries may be built for the holding of Corn, and there to be ſtored up, as in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> and there all things being done by the ſame way, method, rule, and order, as it is at <hi>Marenburgh,</hi> all the Countrey-round for Thirty Miles, will have many and great advantages; and to the Publick, no Tongue can expreſs the ſeveral and ſtrange benefits it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter: As firſt, It will preſerve the Corn from Rats and Mice, and what was formerly deſtroyed by them, now will be kept to feed the Poor. Secondly, It gives the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36927:77"/>Husbandman a great advantage; for he may Thraſh out his Corn, and carry it to be kept ſafe in the Granaries until he hath occaſion to ſell it, and ſo the Conſumption occaſioned by Rats and Mice is wholly prevented; and that which fed Rats and Mice, and other Vermine, and which other accidents deſtroyed, will be preſerved and kept to feed the Poor; which is at leaſt the third part of the Wheat of <hi>England,</hi> if kept Four years in Ricks, Stacks, Barns, Houſes, and Lofts: Alſo the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will, by having a place always ready to lay up his Corn ſafe, have the benefit of his Straw to feed his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and make Muck, Chaff for his Horſes, and light Corn for his Pigs and Poultry, and his Husbandry will be in a regular motion, and anſwer his juſt and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends; whereas if his Corn be Rickt up Three or Four years, his Husbandry is out of order, ſometimes nothing for his ſervants to do, his Pigs half famiſhed, his Cattel lean, want of Muck that this Straw ſhould produce to bring his Husbandry about as it ought to be done; The poor Farmer, nay, Free-holder looks upon his Ricks with ſighs and a heavy heart, he ſeeth there are Vermin in them, which are not to be prevented; ſome owe Moneys upon Intereſt, ſome to their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, but Men will not ſtay long; the Tenant prays patience, Time is given, but ſtill a Plenty is continued, and the Ricks not pulled down; but at laſt neither Uſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor Landlord will ſtay longer: Then the Lawyer is ſet at work, Suits are brought, and there is no ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but trouble, and miſery, all ruined; and into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he muſt, if the Moneys be not paid immediately; and a large and long Lawyers Bill into the bargain.</p>
               <p>I pray, where is now the poor Farmer, and many Free-holders alſo? what muſt they do? what ſhift muſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36927:77"/>they make? Shall they fly to the Kings-Bench, or run away? ſomething muſt be done: I tell thee what, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pull down their Ricks, and Thraſh without doors and within, as faſt as they can ſend the Corn to Market, although never ſo cheap, and the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at that time never ſo much to their damage; and at Market, part of the Moneys made of this Corn, paid for charges at Law; great part of the Corn before the Ricks were pulled down, eaten and conſumed by Rats and Mice. Now obſerve the conſequences of theſe things: The poor honeſt Laborious Countrey-man being thus purſued by Suits in Law, Rats and Mice devouring his Corn when in Ricks, and ſold cheap, and at unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable times; Servants ſeeing his neceſſity, raiſe price of their Labours: This forſthaſt puts his Teams to carry his Corn to Market, and that cauſeth the neglect of that years Husbandry; and truly the end of all this is, no more than this; The Lawyer is paid his Bill, for he will, or elſe no Team nor Maſter neither muſt come to Market; the Servants wages paid that Thraſhed out the Corn; the Uſerer paid what the Farmer owes him; but you will ſay, what ſhall the Landlord have? I will tell you what, he will be ſure of his Farm thrown upon his hands, and that preſent years profit loſt; nay, and when he comes to ſtock it himſelf, he may poſſibly loſe his Rent, and the intereſt of his ſtock put upon the Land; and when he ſets it again, loſe Twenty in the Hundred, and glad to get a Tenant to take it ſo: But that which is worſe, The Tenant and Landlord are then in the worſt condition, and their Families and Eſtates out of order. Moneys is moſt wanting, and Trade moſt dead in times when Corn is very cheap; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, That the Corn lies in Ricks, and no Man can, or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36927:78"/>is benefited or ſecured by it; only there is a merry Feaſt for Rats and Mice: And if it hold cheap for Three or Four years, the Tenant lays the Key under the Door, and then the Wolf is knawing a hole in at the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords Door; I am ſure his head is in already, therefore I ſay, timely prevent him from getting in his body: For after death there is no redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Landlord ſeeing his Tenant in this way, ſending his Corn into the Publick Bank-Granary, and there lodging it, will know the quantities, which muſt be affixt, and ſet up in a Catalogue in ſome place of the Granary, thereby to be viewed and taken notice by any that think they are, or may be concerned therein; and ſuch Corn being in Granary, the Tenant may tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to the Landlord, or any part thereof; and ſo the Landlord will always be in ſuch a condition, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf, and to prevent his Farms being thrown upon his hands; for if the Landlord feeth his Tenant a good Husband, and doth the beſt he can to live, then he will forbear, and give him time, and no danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is able to give his Landlord Bank-Credit in Corn for his Rent; and ſo the Corn is kept and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a good Market, and at laſt the Landlord paid all his Rent, and the Tenant enabled to maintain his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and to Husband his Farm to the beſt advantage: And I think here is no harm done, unleſs the prevention of Law-Suits, and the miſeries attending them, and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rats and Mice of their large feaſts, that laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Three or Four years, be injuſtice; beſides the Landlord hath his advantage clearly before him, he may fee at all times the condition of his Tenant; for if he will not come to the Publique <hi>Granary</hi> with his Corn, whereby the Landlord may be ſecured upon the Ticket
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:36927:78"/>thereof for his Rent, but keep it to make the Rats and Mice feaſts; then he may Command preſent payment of his Rents, or take a new Tenant: But I believe many Gentlemen, and others, will after reading of my Book twice over, ſee it ſo much their Intereſt to have Publique Granaries, that they will be upon building ſome in many places in <hi>England,</hi> before any Law paſſes to put them into a poſture: and obſerve, when this Corn is in the Publique-bank-Granary in the Countrey, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately it is to be Regiſtred at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> So it will be immediately good credit to inliven Trade, and fetch out all Moneys now unimploy'd, and prevent Law, and the trouble of attending it: The Tenant, Landlord, and Trade will have their ends an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and there is no way under Heaven at preſent to inliven Trade, preſerve Landlord and Tenant, and bring the unimploy'd Moneys out, but this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Corn being lodged ſafe, and kept in the Publique Granary, will be the occaſion immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of fetching out, and bringing forth moſt of the Caſh of <hi>England,</hi> now wholly unimploy'd. All people near the Publique-bank-Granaries will immediately be deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have ſome Corn in Bank-credit, for that cannot miſs of finding an increaſe and benefit to them in the Riſe of Corn. There will alſo tumble into the Publique-bank for Corn, all the Moneys round the Countrey, now in the Servants hands, both Men and Maids (which at preſent lies dead in their Cheſts); and then <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Joan</hi> will make a merry bout when Corn riſes, praiſe and pray for the Man that brought the Publique bank to New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and drink his Health in Burnt-Clarret: In <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> it is thus with all Servants. And there is no way that mortal man can
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36927:79"/>invent to fetch the unimploy'd Moneys into Trade with ſpeed, but this only way. The Titles of Land now are ſo uncertain, and perſonal ſecurity ſo bad, Moneys will grow ſcarcer, and ſcarcer, and Trade deader, and deader: and our Neighbours beyond the Seas, are ſo linkt and faſtned with our Merchants here, that the poor Countrey people, and Landlords alſo, ſhall be but Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water, unleſs by this way relieved. Conſider, Into this Corn-bank will be laid all the Moneys of all poor labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, who keep no Teems; for here is their great advantage, they laying by Corn when cheap, in the Granary, there kept ſafe, ſweet, and good; it's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and very probable, theſe poor men, nor their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, never eat dear Bread after in all their lives; ſo here will be no poor in the Pariſh, nor complaining in the Streets for Bread: And as I formerly ſaid, here is no harm done, but cheating the Rats and Mice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider, Corn being lodged in cheap times in theſe Publique Granaries of New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> will cauſe the Linnen and Thred-Trade upon a ſudden to come to perfection; for there will be Bread and Drink always cheap; and that being ſo, there is ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for men to venture upon any new Trade; But if Victuals, as Bread and Drink, prove dear, and uncertain in its Rates and Priſes; from thence Trade will depart, and find out ſome place that ſhall fit and pleaſe her better: For as Honour, and Honeſty, brings Riches, and Strength, ſo cheap Victuals, and good, with all things neceſſary and cheap, to be imployed in the Manufacture, will thereby be the occaſion of ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the place, and making of it Rich, and cauſe Trade in proceſs of time to leave the place where
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36927:79"/>ſhe was formerly, and come where ſhe may be better entertained, and more advantageouſly accommodated: I find that Miſtris called Trade, will bow and bend to every juſt and good thing, wherein ſhe may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and not in danger to be famiſhed; and therefore I have provided her good Granaries to hold her food, which is good Wheat and Malt, to make her Bread and Drink; I have alſo given order for the preparing of good Flax, to make her fine Linnen; I have provided her a fit place, with good Merchants, to make that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Liquor called Mum; I have alſo provided her a Navigable River, with Cuts to be made to her Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſo that Barges may carry and re-carry her Goods and Riches up and down, to Sea, and from Sea; I have travelled to <hi>Magdenburgh,</hi> to ſee to fit her with Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as good, if not better than there is; I have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> to find a way to fit her with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dſires, as to good Mum; I have travelled into <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to ſee her fine-ſpun Threds, Wheels and Looms, that ſo ſhe may want nothing; I have travelled into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> to ſee her Weaving and White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with all its advantages. And now dear Miſtreſs, I certainly muſt court thee in thy flight, to fall down into New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> near <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> and into New-<hi>Harlem</hi> in the Mannor of <hi>Anilcot;</hi> and there thou ſhalt be attended with the Riches of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> as to Mum; as alſo with the Riches of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> as to Corn; thou ſhalt alſo be attended with the Riches of <hi>Saxony,</hi> as to Flax and fine Threds: And to compleat all, thou ſhalt have on the Backſide of thy Towns, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Bleach and Whiten thy fine Linnen, being the Lands of the Earl of <hi>Middleſex;</hi> equal to <hi>Harlem</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> for all conveniences, if not better.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:36927:80"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I call all thoſe People to be Judges, who have great quantities of Corn, and are forced to keep it Two or Three years in Ricks, whether it loſeth not at leaſt one fourth part of the Corn by Vermin, Rats, Mice, and other accidents: and if kept Four or Five years, many times the one half is conſumed; beſides the miſeries before ſpoken of, that attend the Landlord, Tenant, and Creditor. Now this Publick Granary is the cauſe of preſerving all this Corn, that otherwiſe would have been conſumed by Rats and Mice; and as I ſaid in my Book, That we may beat the <hi>Dutch</hi> without fighting, now I ſay, and affirm, That all the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> will be fed with Bread ſufficient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being chargeable to the Publick for any thing: For they have the Corn to ſupply them for Bread, which the Rats and Mice did deſtroy.</p>
               <p>Now Reader, I pray thee ſeriouſly conſider, whether the Seed of a Voluntary Regiſter, is not convenient to be with all ſpeed ſowed upon this ſurfeited <hi>Engliſh</hi> Field; all People that know any thing, know that Seed long ſowed on the ſame Land over and over, brings the Farmer at laſt to Beggery; I queſtion not, but thou art convinc'd this Publick Granary well ordered, with the Corn put into it, will feed all the poor People of <hi>England,</hi> taking nothing but what would be eat and deſtroyed by Rats, Mice, and other accidents: All you that Read this, conſider what cheap Victuals, and certain, will do to moſt Manufactures; and the cheapneſs, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it with us: So here is good Corn and cheap, and much Plenty; here is excellent good Land to bear Flax, and great quantities of it; here a covenient place may be made to draw Water out of <hi>Avon</hi> River, to ſupply the Bleaching and Whiting: Here is at preſent, no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36927:81"/>Trade, or Manufacture, nor any ſettled within Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Miles of the place; here you are in an excellent plentiful Countrey of Fleſh, and all other proviſions; but that which crowns the deſign, you are at the Head of a Navigable River, by which you will have with eaſe and cheapneſs, all the Flax, Cloth, Thred, Tape, and other things, ſent down the River <hi>Avon</hi> into <hi>Severn,</hi> and ſo for Sea, <hi>Briſtol, Wales, Shropſhire,</hi> and many other places; and all things you ſtand in need of will be brought up the River <hi>Avon,</hi> to New-<hi>Brunſwick:</hi> And I ſay, God and Nature, with the River <hi>Avon</hi> being made Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hath ſo ſtrangely accommodated New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and New-<hi>Harlem,</hi> and fitted it for this Linnen, nay, I ſay, fine Linnen Trade; that certainly, no part in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> can compare with it.</p>
               <p>As to the Third, That which is to be the Publick Granary to keep the Corn for all Gentlemen, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and Farmers that pleaſe to ſend it thither, that ſo the deſtruction and damages occaſioned by Rats and Mice may be prevented; I ſay, in this Granary, Corn at all times ſhall be taken in, from all perſons that pleaſe to ſend it; and the Corn ſo ſent; muſt be preſerved ſweet, ſafe, and in good order, for one Peny the Buſhel for a whole year, and the owner at liberty to take it out at his own will and pleaſure; or to ſell, transfer, or aſſign any part of the ſaid Corn to any Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for the payment of his Debts, or in Mortgage to pay his Landlord his Rent; and the Granary-keepers to give good ſecurity, that all things ſhould be faithfully done and diſcharged. Now the Corn being brought into the Publick Granary, and there Regiſtred in the Regiſter Book, to be kept for that purpoſe; and the Perſon that hath put in the ſaid Corn, taking a Note
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36927:82"/>under the Hand and Seal from the Granary-Regiſter, of the quantity of Corn brought into the Granary, with the time it was delivered, with the Matter and kind of the Corn; Then theſe advantages will enſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Farmer will have all the advantages I ſpoke of before, as preſervation from Rats and Mice, Straw to ſupply his Cattel, the Chaff for his Horſes; and the light Corn to feed his Pigs and Poultry, and the Muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill in a regular conſtant quantity; his Husbandry Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with rule and order to his advantage, no forc't-haſt; but Thraſhing, and carrying the Corn to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in times wherein his Servants have leaſure; ſo in Seeding-time, and Harveſt, all People are freed for that, and only that imploy: The Corn being in the Granary, prevents the miſery of Law, and the charge attending it; the Landlord ſecured his Rent, or part thereof, by receiving a Ticket from the Granary-Regiſter, of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain quantity of Corn there lodged, the property being Transferred from the Tenant to the Landlord, and entred in the Regiſter; this Corn in Granary gives the Tenant Credit to take up Moneys to furniſh his occaſions, ſo as he may manage his affairs, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his Land to the beſt advantage, and prevent the ſad effects that commonly attends the want of preſent Moneys for his neceſſary occaſions; and for want of Credit, many times the laborious honeſt Countrey Farmer is undone, and forc't to come and live upon the Pariſh; and the Land he was Tenant to muſt now help to maintain him; whereas, if prevention had been time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out, againſt the Rats with Two Legs, that ſo charge of Law-Suits had been prevented, the Corn kept ſafe in a Granary, and preſerved from the Rats and Mice with Four Legs, then the Landlord had been paid
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36927:82"/>his Rents, the Tenant preſerved, the Uſerer paid, the charge and trouble of Law avoided, and all miſeries now upon Landlord, Tenant, and Creditor, not ſo much as heard of: And for that all theſe ſort of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may for the future be prevented, and ſufficient means and remedies preſcribed for the doing thereof; I ſhall here give you the ways, means, rules, orders, methods, directions, and policies, whereby they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will be with eaſe accompliſhed; for they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſo done in <hi>Germany,</hi> and have moſt ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in theſe parts, in the advance of Trade, and procuring of Riches: And it will be with us (if once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed) as if one were raiſed from the dead.</p>
               <p>I propoſe, and hope to ſee Three large Granaries built at New-<hi>Brunſwick;</hi> one whereof to be appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Perſons that ſet up Brewing of Mum, one to be appropriated to, and for the keeping of Corn for a ſtock for the poor of the Countrey, and for to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the People that work in the Linnen Manufacture; and one to be a publick Granary for all Gentlemen and Farmers to ſend their Corn into, when Thraſhed, to prevent the deſtruction which is made by Rats and Mice, when it is in Ricks, Barns, Chambers and Lofts. And of the advantage that theſe Granaries will be, I will ſpeak particluarly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Granary built to take in Corn for the uſe of the Brewers of Mum, will be the life of that Trade; and without ſuch Granaries, it is impoſſible to ſet on that Trade: For Corn muſt be bought in ſuch times as this year is, it being not only now very good, but cheap alſo; and in a cheap year they may take in Four or Five years Stock, as they do at <hi>Magdenburgh</hi> and <hi>Shenibank:</hi> Then ſuppoſe the Wheat now coſt two
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36927:83"/>Shillings Four-pence the Buſhel at New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and that be kept Four years in the Granary at Two-pence the Buſhel for Granary Rent; then the Corn will lye the Mum-Brewers in Two Shillings Six-pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, and that is cheaper than it is ſold in any time at Old-<hi>Brunſwick;</hi> and it is ſeldom, but once in Four years, there is a plentiful year of Corn in <hi>England,</hi> and in this year the Brewers may ſupply their Granaries again: And as I ſaid before, here is cheap Corn, good Corn, and a multitude of it, the place of Trade fixt at the Head of a Navigable River, good and cheap Fuel to be made uſe of, with a quick paſſage to the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies, Ireland, Mediteranian, Spain, France, Holland,</hi> and a large paſſage at Sea to bring it to <hi>London,</hi> to help and make the Mum good, by putting it into a ſecond fermentation: And I ſay, here this Trade of making Mum may be fixt with very great advantage; and if once well fixt, from thence it cannot depart, no place in <hi>England</hi> being of that advantage to anſwer all the ends, as this place is.</p>
               <p>The Second Granary, which is to be ſupplyed by the Country with Corn, and there to be kept ſafe for the benefit of thoſe that work in the County in the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-Manufacture, and to ſupply the Poor when a dearth comes; Corn will be kept Four years in the Granaries, and the Rate then will be but Two Shillings Six-pence the Buſhel; and with this cheap Corn the People will be ſupplyed with Bread, whereby they will make and perfect the intended Linnen-Manufacture very cheap; and this conſtancy of Bread, and at cheap rates, will certainly be a great and certain means of fixing the fine Linnen Trade at New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and New-<hi>Harlem:</hi> And the Reaſons are theſe, near the very Place are great
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36927:83"/>quantities of Land excellent good to bear Flax, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good places may with a little art, be made by the Town-ſides to Whiten and Bleach Linnens; and within one Mile of New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> there is the Mannor of <hi>Milcot,</hi> being the Lands of the Earl of <hi>Midd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="5 letters">

               <p n="7">7.

               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Conſider at this day, the Land-ſecurity being not good, many Gentlemen pay Eight, Nine, and Ten in the Hundred for the Moneys they take up, and go upon the Tick for all Commodities; and when they pay, it is double the value as if bought with ready Moneys: The very bane of many eſtates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Conſider, that no great thing can be done without ready Moneys, or Credit; Lands Regiſtred will be both, and Land will riſe purchaſe, and Trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> Conſider, of what ſad conſequence it is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36927:86"/>with us in <hi>England</hi> at this day, that we cannot have Bonds and Bills Transferred by Aſſignments, ſo as the Property may go a-long with the Aſſignment; thereby one Bond or Bill, will go in the nature of Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change: And ſo <hi>A.</hi> owing Two hundred pounds to <hi>B.</hi> he Aſſigns him the Bond of <hi>C.</hi> who owed him Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, and <hi>C.</hi> owing <hi>D.</hi> Two hundred pounds, Aſſigns him the Bond of <hi>E.</hi> who owed him Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; and ſo one Bond or Bill, would go through Twenty hands, and thereby be as ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and do much to the benefit of Trade, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent infinite vexatious Suits, and prevent the ruin of ſome hundreds of Families: For as the Law now is practiſed at this day, although the word Aſſign be in the Bond, yet the Property of the Bond paſſes not; but the party Aſſigning, his Heirs, Executors or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators may diſcharge the Bond by a Releaſe. And pray obſerve the miſerable calamity that the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lye under for want of this being not done; now <hi>A.</hi> owes <hi>B.</hi> Two hundred pounds, the Bond being Four hundred pounds, for the payment of Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. <hi>B.</hi> ſends a Writ into the Countrey, and arreſts <hi>A.</hi> he cannot get ſuch Bayle as the Sherif will accept: So perhaps lieth a Month or longer in Priſon, his Wives heart almoſt broke, Children and Friends ſorrowful; At laſt the Wife importunes Friends of hers to be bound for his appearance; but he cannot get ſpecial Bayle above; then the Attorneys and Sherifs harveſt comes in; they preſently make three Suits of one, and fall on the poor Security. At laſt Bayle is put in above; then Common-Law-Tryals, Demurrers, Writs of Error, Chancery. So Plantif and Defendant many times ruine one the other. Whereas if a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36927:87"/>Bond were Transferable, and the property to paſs it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bond, and good Men bound in it; this Bond would run from Man to Man, from Hand to Hand, from one Tradeſman to another; and ſo one Bond would pay twenty Men; for people at this day would be glad to have payments made them in ſuch Paper ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than go to Law for their own; and often undo their Creditor, and ſometimes themſelves to. It would be a mighty benefit to Trade and Commerce to have Bonds transfer'd. A poor man in <hi>England</hi> that hath a Thouſand pounds in Bonds with good Sureties bound, cannot pay one hundred pounds of his Debts with them. Our Free-lands being put under a Voluntary Regiſter, and the property of Bonds being made Transferable by aſſignment, will be a great profit to the Nation.</p>
               <p>As things are now, we have not one fourth part of Moneys ſufficient to drive the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> and ſet up the neglected Fiſhery, improve our own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and to anſwer peoples juſt, honeſt, and lawful occaſions. But if the Free-lands were Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and Bonds Transferable, then we ſhould have three parts in four more Caſh than we ſhould have occaſion to uſe: For the Land Regiſtred, will do what Money now doth; and this is credit equal to Moneys; and then we ſhall do what the <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TCH</hi> now do, never want Moneys to do any great thing. But we muſt ſubmit our ſelves in all things to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Gracious Pleaſure and Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> It will by its credit, be the cauſe of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at work all the poor of <hi>England</hi> in the Linnen and Iron-Manufacture, and ſo convenience the Woollen-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, that it will be as one that were riſen from the dead.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> Conſider, That the want of a Regiſter will make us in few years like unto a Wheat-rick, that hath ſtood many years; when it is opened, all the Corn is conſumed by Rats and Mice, and nothing left but the Straw and Clothings.</p>
               <p>It would be well if thoſe worthy <hi>Virtuoſoes</hi> that intend the good of the Publique, and have real intentions to improve Mecanick Arts, that they and all ſuch Lords and Gentlemen that wiſh well thereto, with ſpeed would advance a Sum of Moneys to build an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for the Improvement of Art in <hi>England,</hi> and to maintain Six perſons continually Travelling to find out ſuch Improvements; and the way of bringing them to paſs, as may be for the real good of the Publique; the pattern how to ſettle ſuch a Univerſity, for Art, they may have from one long ſince ſetled near <hi>Newringburg</hi> in <hi>Germany:</hi> The conſequence whereof hath ſo imyrov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mecanick-Art in <hi>Germany,</hi> that no place in the World comes near them for Art.</p>

               <p n="1">1. COnſider what quantities of fine Linnens are made in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and here worn and conſumed, and how many hands it imploys in work to manufacture it, and the great benefit the <hi>Dutch</hi> gain, being the great Maſters of that Trade.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that if theſe fine Clothes were made here, how it would imploy the Poor, raiſe the price of Land, and keep our Moneys at home; for the <hi>Dutch</hi> take nothing from us in exchange, wherein the benefit is any way conſiderable to the publick.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. Conſider, the <hi>French</hi> take nothing of any value from us, but it is ready money for their Linnens; ſo we keep their people at work, and ſend them our moneys to pay them for it, and our own Poor are unimploy'd: But if a Tax were laid upon their coarſe Linnen Clothes, then what is brought out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> would be made here of our own growth, to the Nations great enriching.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider the Twine and Yarn ready wrought
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36927:88"/>and brought out of the Eaſt-Country to make Sail-Cloth and Cordage, which hath taken off the labour of multitude of people in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and thereabouts, and hath ſo leſſened that Trade, that it is almoſt loſt: But if a Tax were laid upon the threds brought over ready wrought, then the labour of all ſuch things would be here to ſupply our Poor at work, and raiſe the price of our Lands.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7. Conſider, the Foreign Bed-ticking coming hither cheap, hath almoſt deſtroyed that Trade in <hi>Dorcetſhire</hi> and <hi>Somerſetſhire;</hi> and ſo the Spinners are Idle, and the Land falls price; and in this, as in other things, we ſend our Moneys into Foreign parts, to keep their Poor at work, and ſupport them; and here we ſtarve our own, and loſe that Trade: A Tax upon Foreign Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticking would prevent all this.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Conſider, If there be not timely courſe taken by the Parliament, to provide for the incloſure of the Commons in theſe parts, which lye convenient to theſe Iron Mines and Works, to encreaſe Woods; in a very ſmall time, the Manufacture will be much leſſened, and will prove the great impoveriſhing of the Countreys where now they are, and of much damage to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in general.</p>

And in theſe Countreys there are great quantities of Pit-Coals, which are in all

               <p n="4">4.

Conſider, the Landlord may at any time have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys upon Bank-Corn, transferred from his Tenant to him for Rent; and thereby inable the Landlord upon that Credit, to take up moneys at all times to anſwer his juſt occaſions: and the Corn being Regiſtred in the County, and alſo at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in London, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely enliven Trade; and Bills for Corn in Banks will be as good as ready moneys, and thereby prevent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of miſchiefs that attend want of preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that Bank-Granaries will prevent the poor peoples miſeries, for want of food, in ſome wet and unſeaſonable years; and will be the occaſion of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite poor people off the Pariſh, and prevent others falling upon the Pariſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, it is the true intereſt of all Gentlemen that have many Tenants in great Corn-Countreys, to build Granaries upon their charges, and take in their own Tenants and Neighbours Corn, and receive from them payment for keeping thereof: And if this comes to be put in practice by the Gentlemen, the next thing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:36927:91"/>they will then be at, Is to ſet their Sons upon Imploy in the Linnen Manufacture; for it will be then perfectly diſcovered, that Bank-Corn may always be delivered out to the poor, in payment for their work: As now Iron, Wool, Silk, Threads, any Wier, is delivered out to the Smith, Clothier, Weaver, Pin-maker, in part of payment for the Manufactured Commodities,; for at this time moſt payments are made to the poor Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft-man, part Moneys, and part ſuch Materials as the Commodity was made of which he ſells, and he is forc'd to take the Materials at ſuch Rates as his Chapman plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to impoſe, or put upon it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, Theſe Bank-Granaries will bring out all the Moneys now unimployed, and at preſent out of Trade, and prevent the keeping of ſuch quantities of Plate which is now made uſe of by many People; for the Bank-Corn being ready Moneys at all times, there will be no occaſion of ſuch quantities of Plate as moſt People keep by them; which at preſent is made uſe of by many perſons for their immediate Credit.</p>
               <p>I being at <hi>Dublin</hi> in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy four, there happened a great Storm, which very much ſhattered the Ships lying in the Harbor, and blew one to Sea, where Ship and Men periſhed; and blew another upon the Rocks, near the point of <hi>Voth,</hi> where ſhe was ſtaved and broke to pieces, her lading and part of the Men periſhed; at which time I heard many and frequent complaints, by Merchants and Seamen, of the badneſs of that Harbor, and the danger that attended the Ships lying there at Anchor; by reaſon of hard Sand, low Water, and the continual hazard the Ships were in when the Winds blew hard; there being no Hill or Promontory to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:36927:92"/>them from great winds: I alſo found by diſcourſe with the Lord Mayor <hi>Brewſter,</hi> and many others, that the badneſs of the Harbour did occaſion the decreaſe of Trade and was of great prejudice to it, and the City alſo. I then acquainted the Lord Mayor of my thoughts, As to the making a very good Harbour at <hi>Rings-end:</hi> Upon which he did Importune me to beſtow ſome time in a Survey, and diſcovery thereof; the which I did, and ſpent about three weeks time in finding out what is here aſſerted. Firſt, As to the damage of Trade, by reaſon of the badneſs of the Harbour. Secondly, The advantage it will be to Trade, if a ſafe Harbour were made. Thirdly, The way how a good Harbour may be made; with a large Cittadel, and a place for all Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, and Naval Stores. And Fourthly, What it will coſt the doing.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt, The Ships that lye at Anchor, a mile below <hi>Rings-end,</hi> lye upon very hard Sands when the Tide is out; and thereby much damnifying the Ships, if either old or weak built: And the goods are littered to and from the Ships, and many times the Ships receive very great Damage by Storms and great Winds; and ſo the Ships Crew muſt always be on Board for fear of foul weather: and the Harbour being ſo bad, cauſes Trade to weaken at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Second, If there were a Harbour made at <hi>Rings-end,</hi> as in the Map deſcribed, this advantage would be gained: At preſent there is at leaſt five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> paid to perſons that carry and re-carry people in the <hi>Rings-end</hi> Coaches to and from the Ships, all that would be ſaved. And all the labour and pains that is now taken by Merchants, Owners, and Sea-men, going from <hi>Dublin</hi> to the Ships, ſaved: the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:36927:92"/>great charge at preſent, by carrying and re-carrying goods by Litters, to and from the Ships, prevented; much more Trade brought, if the new Harbour were made for Ships, that cannot lye upon them hard Sands: And in the new Harbour the Ships will always be float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the water being by art with Sluces kept to thirteen foot depth; and thereby any weak or crazy Ship will lye there ſafe, and receive no damage at all. A Boy and a Dog in the new Harbour will look to a Ship: And the owner ſtaying any conſiderable time for Lading, will in the mean time permit part of the Ships Crue to go ſhort Voyages, to <hi>Cheſter, Leverpool, Bristol,</hi> and the Weſt of <hi>England;</hi> which will be for the benefit of Trade, and thereby Mariners will not be wanting: And all the ſad and dangerous perils now ſuffered by the Ships in the <hi>Bay</hi> where they now lye, prevented: And by the Ships coming up boldly to <hi>Laſey</hi> Hill, there Trade will be made eaſie; the Merchant, Owner, and Ships, all being together. The wiſe and knowing people in <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> ſay, If the new Harbor were made, there would be Ten thouſand pound <hi>per annum</hi> advance in the Kings Cuſtoms yearly.</p>
               <p>As to the Third, There may be made a good Harbor neer <hi>Rings-end,</hi> in the ſpare piece of Ground that now is every Tide covered with water, which lyes betwixt <hi>Rings-end</hi> and <hi>Laſey</hi>-Hill: And in that piece of Land Cuts may be made, as in the Map deſcribed, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Houſes built in one piece, and Houſes for the Slaughter-men, Sea-men, and Fiſhers, in the other piece. And in theſe Cuts all Veſſels will lye with that eaſe and ſafety, that it will be to the owners of great advantage, and prevent the preſent charge they are put unto by Multiplicity of men; and ſo make Trade Eaſie, Cheap,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36927:93"/>and delightful; and at the upper end of one of the Cuts, there may be made a very ſtrong Cittadel, and Houſes for all manner of Stores, which may prove of great convernment to that Kingdom; for there is an old Saying, <hi>Two ſtrings are better than one:</hi> For this Cittadel may be made in that place, with ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that none can be ſtronger or better anſwer the ends for which it is intended, then this may do; for at preſent the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> is in a hole in the middle of the Town, and ſo may many ways miſs of the ends that it was intended for; beſides, in the Caſtle there is very little room for any Military Stores, which would be here very well ſupplied: And the way for making this Harbor to anſwer all the ends here preſcribed, is by making the Cuts as you ſee in the Map, with build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two great Stone Locks or Sluces to let down and bring up the Ships; and for ſupplying theſe Cuts or Trenches with Water, the Brook coming from <hi>Rofarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Robuck,</hi> muſt be made uſe of; and the Brook now running by <hi>Dublin</hi>-Caſtle muſt be taken up at the ſide of the Caſtle, and carried a-croſs <hi>Georges Lane,</hi> and ſo through a waſte piece of Land of Sir. <hi>William Petties,</hi> and ſo down to <hi>Laſey</hi> Hill, to help to augment the Trenches in dry times when Water is ſcarce: If this New Harbor were made, no place in <hi>Holland</hi> were anſwerable to it, for its advantage and convenience; and as to the Cittadel, certainly none would exceed it, no not <hi>Delfsee</hi> that ſtrong Fort, being made by the very ſame advantage, as this may be; which is by the little River that comes from <hi>Groningen</hi> to <hi>Delfsee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Fourth, which is the charge of making the Harbor and Cittadel, I have taken a great deal of pains when I was there, caſting up what it might coſt; and I
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36927:93"/>believee it may be compleated for Twenty thouſand pound: and certainly as that Harbor now is, and as that piece of Land is overflowed with water every Tide, and under the very ſides of the City, it is a very great detriment to Trade and Commerce, and of as great diſhonour, becauſe it's relating to the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of a Kingdom; and no place poſſible can offer it ſelf with more advantage, as to Harbour and Cittadel, with eaſe, and increaſe of Trade, than this place doth, if good practicable Art were rightly imployed upon it, and well back'd by a good Law, well made and fitted to anſwer ſo great and noble a deſign as this would be: The Map of the New Harbor, with the ſeveral Cuts for the Ships to lye in, with the Cittadel, is hereunto af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt.</p>
               <p>I know writing Books of Trade, where preſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is not within the reach of the Readers underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, puts a ſilence unto the whole Hiſtory, be it never ſo good; for all men are governed by what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, in matters relating to gain or loſs: But it ſhall be my way to come as near as poſſibly I can to the underſtandings of the parties I intend to appropriate this Diſcourſe unto. Therefore I will now try my Pen, to ſee whether I can get it to beat an Alarm unto all the poor Handicraft People in Three places, <hi>viz. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, Worceſterſhire,</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> and I queſtion not, but if they give attendance, and obſerve the firſt word of Command (which is Silence) they ſhall hear in one hour ſuch things uttered, as will ſend them home rejoycing: And firſt I ſhall ſpeak of <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> Secondly, of <hi>VVorceſterſhire:</hi> and, Thirdly, of <hi>London.</hi> I have ſaid in my former Diſcourſe, wherever there is cheapneſs of Victuals, good Laws, and a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:36927:94"/>Navigable River, there Trade may be moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> part of that County is already well improved; Firſt, it hath a Navigable River unto the City made by Art; but imperfect at preſent, and ought to be mended. Secondly, all <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rchinfield</hi> is now under a great improvement by Clover, which improvement I ſent into them parts, by ſending the ſeed, with Books fully directing the Husbandry; and all perſons at firſt had liberty to receive Seed from Mr. <hi>Belamy</hi> of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and Books of Directions: If the Husbandry did take, and the profit made, as in the Book was preſcribed, then they were to pay Seven-pence a pound for the Seed; if not, nothing: By this way the Seed was put into the Husbandmans hand, and no venture to him; and there was no other way to force that Husbandry upon the People, all former people failing in that deſign for want of good directions: And at preſent, certainly <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> is doubled in the value of their Lands by the Clover Husbandry.</p>
               <p>The ſecond improvement <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> is under, is ſending their Sider to <hi>London</hi> ready Bottled; which Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, or Art, I and my Partner ſeveral years ſince put there on foot, and cauſed vaſt quantities to be Bottled up and ſent to <hi>Glocester,</hi> from thence to <hi>Lechload,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London</hi> by Water; we had not been in that method a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two years, but others did begin to tread the ſame ſteps, and now it is a great Trade, and a great number of perſons are now driving great Trades with Bottle-Sider; and it hath been the occaſion of erecting Five or Six Glaſs-Houſes in them parts. And in <hi>VVorcesterſhire,</hi> I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſuccesful in putting that County under Two improvements, I ſhall in its place venture at a Third; I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:36927:94"/>know it is very capable to receive it: there is one publick ſpirited Man lately come into that Countrey, who hath ſeveral times deſired me to acquaint him which way the Countrey might be improved, and Manufacture ſetled, and declared that he would lay out Moneys and his pains for the good of the Publick.</p>
               <p>At preſent there is no ſettled Trade at <hi>Hereford,</hi> but the Poor of that Town, and the Countrey round have little imploy, notwithſtanding they have there very great conveniences, and a Navigable River to the very City, with much Corn, and that excellent good; and in all ſuch times as this is, Corn is there very cheap and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; and when cheap, they have no Market to go unto thereby to vend their Corn: Formerly <hi>VVales</hi> took away their Corn when plentiful, but ſince the <hi>VVelſh</hi> took to break up their Mountains, and ſow them with Corn, they have Corn ſufficient for themſelves, and much to ſpare; ſo that County ſhall be always under a plenty, unleſs ſome ſetled Manufacture be there fixt, thereby to bring People, and imploy the Poor which are there already: But it is impoſſible ever to fix any New Manufacture with ſucceſs, unleſs all things that are required for the doing thereof, be well ordered, as to cheapneſs of Victuals, and all other conveniences.</p>
               <p>Therefore at <hi>Hereford,</hi> in the firſt place, there muſt be Granaries built to hold Corn, and there ſtow'd in the time of plenty; and this Corn muſt be apropriated wholly for the uſe of theſe People that work in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture; and thereby they never will eat dear Bread, or drink dear Drink; and the Granaries muſt be made as I have directed: And the beſt Trade that I know which will moſt fit that place, becauſe it can never miſs of a plenty, as to Bread and Drink, will be fine-ſpun
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36927:95"/>Threds and Tape; and my Reaſons why that will be moſt fitteſt for that place, are theſe; Firſt, <hi>Hereford</hi> is at the head of a Navigable River. Secondly, It is on the Borders of <hi>VVales;</hi> and if they want hands, and the Trade ſhould enlarge it ſelf, from <hi>VVales</hi> there would pour down People upon them, when they ſee there is Moneys to be gained. Thirdly, By the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Navigable River, all things will be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to and from them, to ſupply the Trade with eaſe and cheapneſs. Fourthly, At preſent there is no ſetled Manufacture. Fifthly, That place will anſwer well to furniſh with their Commodities all <hi>VVales</hi> up <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, Bristol,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> And where that Trade is ſetled in foreign parts, the Places are very Rich; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Friburgh</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Holland:</hi> Theſe Two Towns are the great Maſters of theſe Trades; <hi>Friburgh</hi> for Tape, and <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> for Threds: And certainly at <hi>Hereford</hi> theſe Commodities may be made as cheap as in any part of <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Holland:</hi> But ſtill regard is to be had to theſe things, cheap Bread and Drink, and always certain; Moneys at low intereſt, with Spinning-Schools, as I have directed in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe; with Four ſhillings in the pound advance of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms to be laid upon all Threds and Tapes brought from beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p>I know there are ſome Gentlemen of the Country I now treat of, will be very inquiſitive, and deſirous to know how this Trade ſhall be fixt at firſt; and when fixt, how to govern it, that it may not miſcarry, as did the Linnen Manufacture at <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> and many other Publick Linnen Manufactures formerly ſet up in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will give them my thoughts at preſent, which is the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:36927:96"/>beſt and convenienteſt way for the ordering of the Thred and Tape-Trade at <hi>Hereford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Build your Granary, and Stock it with Corn and Malt for Three years, ſufficient for ſo many People as are to be imployed; then build a Brew-houſe and a Bake-houſe both together, cloſe by your Granaries, for your Manufacturing People, and to be delivered to them as they ſpend it; for it is a great Error with us in <hi>England,</hi> that Publick Bake houſes and Brew-houſes are not fixt for the ſupply of the ſeveral Handicraft Trades, thereby to ſave all the time now ſpent in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Bread and Drink for the family, which time might be better imployed in their ſeveral Trades; and having the Bread and Drink at all times provided to their hands, will prevent the laying out of Moneys for ſuch uſes, and Houſes of leſs Rent will ſerve their turns; and then all the People in the Family will be in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant imploy of the Trade.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Send for one Man from <hi>Friburgh,</hi> to put you in the true way and Method of making of the Tape; and to bring over two Engines, one to Weave Narrow Tape, and the other to weave Broad Tape, with Wheels to Spin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Send for one Man from <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> to put you in the true way of ordering the fine Threds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Send for a Spinning Miſtriſs out of <hi>Germany,</hi> to order and govern the little Maids, and inſtruct them in the Art of Spinning.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Send for a Man from <hi>Harlem</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> to Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your Tapes and Threds.</p>
               <p>This being done, with all things before ſpecified, That Trade cannot miſs taking great root at <hi>Hereford,</hi> and in proceſs of time will be the ſtaple Trade of that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:36927:97"/>part of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> and no place, as to cheap Victuals of all ſorts, with multitude of hands unimploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, exceeds thoſe parts we treat of: And the thing we now treat of, will be no laborious buſineſs; but may in time prove of great advantage, for the younger Sons of Gentlemen to fall to, and prevent the idle habit that many are now accuſtomed to: And this Trade muſt be of great benefit to the Publick, for at preſent they are Foreign Trades, and the whole benefit does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to them, and the conſumption and loſs to us.</p>
               <p>This Tape and Thred-Trade to be fixt, is of much more difficulty to be brought to perfection, than if there were ſome ſmall Trade in the place already; but the comfort of that place may be, if they once fix well in that Manufacture, then they will deter all others ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the ſame, and ſo conſequently be at laſt the great Maſters of it, as <hi>Manchester</hi> is of all things it Trades in.</p>
               <p>I muſt acquaint the Gentlemen of <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> that the River <hi>Wy</hi> muſt be mended, and made more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than now it is, that ſo Barges may paſs and repaſs with eaſe, and without hazard; for Trade will not admit of ſuch delays, as of neceſſity there muſt be, if the River be not timely mended; and <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> muſt never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to come under a great improvement, if that River be not fully compleated, and the River <hi>Lugg</hi> made Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable as high as <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> or one Mile or two further: And if that were done, then <hi>Hereford</hi> would be to great part of <hi>Radnor, Brecknock, Cardigan,</hi> and <hi>Moumouthſhire,</hi> as <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> is to North-<hi>Wales: Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> lying upon the Navigable River, hath all things brought up to the Town, and thereby invites North-<hi>Wales</hi> by the way of Barter, and otherwiſe, to trade
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36927:97"/>with them. The like will be at <hi>Hereford</hi> to thoſe <hi>Welſh</hi> Countreys I name, if once <hi>Hereford</hi> were ſetled in a conſtant Trade; and that may be with eaſe done, when the River <hi>Wy</hi> is compleated, for then it will have the advantage of joyning its communication with other Rivers: As for Example, it will have all its goods and Siders carried to <hi>London,</hi> and Goods from <hi>London</hi> back by Water to <hi>Hereford,</hi> and ſo the charge of Carriage will be much leſſened, and Trade much more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for at the Head of Navigable Rivers there muſt and will be Trade, provided the River carriage comes once to be made certain and cheap: You may obſerve in the Map of Rivers in the Book, there is a kindneſs intended to <hi>Hereford;</hi> for it is taken into the aſſociation of the Rivers, and why it ſhould be ſo, there are many Reaſons may be given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, Hereford</hi> will ſuck in all Trade of the <hi>Welſh</hi> Counties before named; and there are vaſt quantities of Sider to come for <hi>London;</hi> provided the way take, of making the Rivers of <hi>England</hi> communicable, as in the Book and Map directed: Then <hi>Hereford</hi> will have a great benefit, for the Barges at <hi>Hereford</hi> may be in a conſtant motion, carrying and re-carrying Goods, and all ſuch commodities the Countrey ſends out, or hath occaſion to want, and at very eaſie Rates; and I am ſure it is a pity, and next unto a ſhame, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that hath the beſt of Wool, the beſt of Sider, the beſt of Fruit, the beſt of Wheat, and the beſt of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſhould until this time be unimproved: But ſo it muſt for ever be, unleſs theſe things be done; A vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Regiſter, Publick Granaries, your River <hi>Wy</hi> compleatly made Navigable, Schools as in <hi>Germany</hi> for young Maids to Spin, Bake-houſe and Brew-houſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36927:98"/>to ſupply all People that are in the Manufacture; for Trade will go where ſhe is moſt courted, and beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; witneſs <hi>Holland, Legorn, Hambrough</hi> and <hi>Dantzick:</hi> So much for <hi>Hereford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now for demonſtrating the benefit that may come unto the poor decayed Clothiers of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Kidderminſter,</hi> as alſo to the Cappers of <hi>Bewdley</hi> in their ſeveral Trades, provided they had Granaries to hold Corn in time of plenty; and that ſuch Granaries were fitted and ſetled, as in my Book is directed: And I ſhall diſcover the great miſeries each of theſe Trades now groan under, for want of certain and cheap Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als at all times, as Bread and Drink, with Moneys at low intereſt when they need it, to drive their Trades.</p>
               <p>And firſt, as to the Trade of making Caps at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> it is grown ſo low, that great part of the Ancient Cap-makers in that Town are wholly decayed, and the reſt at this preſent are in a very low condition; and the great poverty that is upon them, renders them to be at the mercy of the <hi>London</hi>-Factors which deal for Caps, that Trade being got into two or three Factors hands, and thereby force the makers to accept of ſuch Rates as they pleaſe to give; whereby that Trade is much decay'd in that Town, and like in few years to fall to the ground: And at preſent there are but Two ways to relieve the People that make Caps in <hi>Bewdley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The one is, to get themſelves Incorporated by Act of Parliament, and therein get ſuch a Law made, as may be for the benefit of the Trade in all particulars; and the Bill muſt, be ſo drawn, that the Traders and Makers of Caps may come under ſuch a Regulation, as may conduce to the benefit of the Trade in general: If they prepare their Parliament-Man to be their Friend,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:36927:98"/>to carry in the Bill next ſitting of Parliament, it will do well.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way to do that Trade good, is by their joining together, and procuring part of a Granary at <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> to put in Corn and Malt when it is cheap, and there to remain for food at all times when they have occaſion to uſe it; and at <hi>Stratford</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts is always the beſt and cheapeſt Wheat and Malt in all them parts of <hi>England;</hi> and from <hi>Stratford</hi> to <hi>Bewdley</hi> it will be carried for one Peny the Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, they having free paſſage through the Locks and Slu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon <hi>Avon,</hi> without paying any Tax for the ſame; the which ſhall be granted, provided I can prevail with my Partners in that River to remit their ſhares: And when there is Corn in Bank, there is a <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and Corn and Malt being taken into Granary when cheap, as this year is, then the Capper and his Family cannot poſſibly eat dear Bread, nor drink dear Drink, and thereby he will be able to drive his Trade with eaſe and Comfort: But I muſt tell the poor Cap-makers not only the benefit of the Corn in Granaries laid up in cheap times, but I muſt alſo tell him, becauſe he is my Neighbour, That there is another piece of good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry to be uſed after the Corn is fixt in the Bank, and that is a material thing to Trades-men, and to poor men that work in all ſorts of Handicrafts; at firſt you will look upon it as a ſlight thing, but when you have well weighed and conſidered of the Reaſons, you will ſay it muſt be: And when you once have it in uſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor any that come after you, will let it fall.</p>
               <p>You muſt have a Bake-houſe and Brew-houſe of your own, appropriated for your Trade, which muſt be fixt and ſet up both together, with ſome ſmall Granaries to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36927:99"/>hold your Corn and Malt; and from this Bake-houſe, and Brew-houſe, at all times you will receive ſuch Bread and Drink as you have occaſion to uſe, or as your part of Corn and Malt comes unto, which you have in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: and the benefits of this Bake-houſe and Brew-houſe will be many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Corn out of the Granary at <hi>Stratford,</hi> will be brought and lodged in Granary at the Bake-houſe, as there is occaſion to make uſe of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prevent the loſs and damage that it would be lyable to, being taken into every Mans private Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> All Bread and Drink being made and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in this Publick Bake-houſe and Brew-houſe, will cauſe the Trades-mans Wife, and Servants, to be at much more leiſure to attend their Trades; for great part of the Womans time is taken up in providing Bread and Drink, getting Fewel, running about to get Yeaſt or Barm, as they call it, and ſometimes ſtay to crack a Pot or two with the good Hoſt that allows them Yeaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This way of a Bake-houſe and Brew-houſe to be uſed for the benefit of the Trade, will prevent all the charge that Trades-men in the Countrey are put unto in buying, and providing all things wanting for theſe purpoſes; as alſo the Trades-men will not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated for ſo great a Houſe, as now he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have; nor to ſit at ſo great a Rent as now he doth: But I know this Publick Brew-houſe and Bake-houſe, will meet with a ſmart objection from moſt of the Cappers Wives that now Brew their own Beer, and that is this, Sir, we Brewing our own Beer, we have Grains for our Pigs, and we cannot be without a Hog or Two. My anſwer is, That from the Publick Brew-houſe,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:36927:99"/>they will have their proportion of Grains ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they put in their quantities of Malt; and if you Brewed your Beer your ſelf, you could have no more: But I know I can pleaſe the Cappers Wives, in telling them what will come to paſs, if they have Corn in theſe Bank-Granaries, and Publick Brew-houſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Malt Brewed in great quantities, makes much more, and better Drink, than if Brewed in many and ſmall parcels.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you have Corn and Malt in Granaries, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>you nor your Family need to eat or drink dear Bread or Drink.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Bank-Corn will alway be ready Moneys in your Purſes, it being a thing that you may Transfer, and ſo alter the property, by entring it with the Clerk of your Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When there is good ſtore of Corn and Malt in Bank, if the Man dies, leaving Five or Six Children, the Widow ſhall not want for a Husband; for there being ſufficient Bread and Drink for Three years in Bank, the Children and Apprentices will be a great benefit to the party that Marries the Widow, and ſo go on comfortably in their Trades: But let a Man as things now are, leave his Wife a Hundred pounds, and dye, and leave her Six Children, ſhe may ſtay long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a Husband; for this Hundred pound poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is at intereſt, and as things are now with us, a Man cannot get one Debt in Three without a Lawyer, and not one in Three to be had without apparent hazard: Now this Bank-Corn Credit will never be queſtioned: ſo the Man being ſure of that as undeniably his own, he will be the eaſier induced to take the Widow, if ſhe hath a few faults; but to take a Widow with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:36927:100"/>conditions, many Children, and her Husbands E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate very hazardous, and uncertain to be recovered, is not prudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Your Corn in Bank is free from all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and ſo frees you from Lawyers, or the charge attending it, and thereby it will give you credit of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Moneys at all times to drive your Trades; Corn in Bank is Money in Purſe, nay better.</p>
               <p>I will give you one inſtance: ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Wowen</hi> of <hi>Bewdley</hi> hath One thouſand quarters of Wheat in the Bank-Granary at <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> which now is worth but One thouſand pound; Mr. <hi>Women</hi> hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Moneys to drive his Trade, he gives notice in Town he wants Five hundred pounds, and will give Bank-Credit in Corn for it; immediately tumbles out the Moneys unimployed, and is lent to Mr. <hi>Wowen,</hi> and the property of Corn by way of Mortgage is Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Five Perſons that lent the Moneys; one of the Perſons that lent Mr. <hi>VVowen</hi> one of the Hundred pounds, ows Mr. <hi>Simon VVood</hi> One hundred pounds, Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> calls for his Moneys, his debtor ſaith he hath no Moneys, he muſt ſtay: No, ſaith Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> I will not, I will ſue you for it: Then the Debtor proffers his Ticket of Bank-Corn to Mr. <hi>VVood,</hi> Mr. <hi>VVood</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the ſecurity, and Transfers the ſame to his Creditor in <hi>London</hi> whom he owes Money to; the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor accepts of it; Why? becauſe he finds it Regiſtred at the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and it is to him ready Moneys any hour in the day, if he want Moneys; but if he doth not want Money, then he ſuffers it to go on, increaſing in Bank, until he hath occaſion to uſe it: And I hope here is no harm done. But I will drive this Nail a little further: Suppoſe this Creditor in <hi>London</hi> of Mr. <hi>Simon
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:36927:100"/>VVoods,</hi> Marries a Daughter, Do you think that this Bank-Ticket of Corn in Granary will not pay part of the portion? Or ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>VVoods</hi> Creditor dies, and leaves to his Wife and Children a Thouſand pounds in Tickets of Bank-Corn in Granary, do you not think it is the beſt viſible ſecurity extant? Yea it is. Do you not think that his Widdow may Marry again to a better advantage, than if this Thouſand pounds were owing by ſeveral Perſons by Book-Debts? I pray, do you think this ſecurity by Bank-Corn in Granary, would not of a ſudden enliven Trade, and make it quick? I ſay it will, and will be the only ſecurity of <hi>England:</hi> And if ever any ſuch thing were deſirable, juſt now is the time; for all Trades are in a conſumption, all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities of Lands uncertain, and perſonal-ſecurity very difficult, and Suits of Law daily multiplied with great charges, and miſerable ſpectacles, Priſons full, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny near periſhing.</p>
               <p>Now good Reader obſerve what benefits and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are here received, by this way of Bank-Corn in Granary; The poor Handicraft Man, Wife, Children, and Servants, are always fed with cheap Bread and Drink, and may be at leaſure if they pleaſe, to follow their Trades the cloſer; becauſe the whole trouble of buying Corn, Grinding, Brewing, Baking, and getting Fuel, is taken off their hands: It alſo prevents the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Moneys in many things, which otherwiſe they muſt have done, if this Publick Brew-houſe and Bake-houſe had not been provided for them; it doth alſo give him eaſe in his Rent, for now a ſmall Houſe will ſerve his turn, and ſo a ſmall Rent paid.</p>
               <p>Obſerve how the party that hath this Bank-Credit in Corn doth convenience himſelf with Moneys when he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:36927:101"/>wants it, and how the Ticket of his Bank-Corn pays the Country Mercer, and with the ſame Ticket, the Mercer pays the <hi>London</hi> Haberdaſher, and with the ſame Ticket, the Haberdaſher takes up Moneys at any time, if he pleaſeth; or if he thinks fit, he Marrieth his Daughter, and gives Bank-Corn in lieu of a Portion; or if he dies, it is a good firm ſetled maintenance for his Wife and Children; and One thouſand pound thus ſetled, may prove better to the poor Widow and her Children, than Five thouſand pounds of any other of her Husbands Credits that lies out.</p>
               <p>And here would riſe a Miracle, if the Cappers of <hi>Bewdley</hi> ſhould turn Bankers; What? the pooreſt Trade of <hi>England!</hi> Yes, they may, and prove a truer, and poſſibly, a better Bank than ever was ſeen in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for all Banks which have good Anchoridg and Foundation, into ſuch Banks will tumble all unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Caſh. If the Cappers come once to have Corn in Bank, to the value of Two thouſand pounds, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately their Neighbours will deſire to come into their aſſociation: And I know there are ſome near <hi>Bewdley,</hi> that have Moneys good ſtore. What is here ſet down for the Cap-makers of <hi>Bewdley,</hi> is alſo intended for the Weavers of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> who are in great fear of the Factors, as they ſay; but I will tell no tales.</p>
               <p>But this I know, if the poor Weavers of <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> had a propriety in a Granary at <hi>Stratford</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Avon,</hi> and a Brew-houſe and Bake-houſe at <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and Corn and Malt in time of plenty laid up, Then I am, and ſo they may be ſatisfied, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for that Trade, ever to depart from that Town; for cheap Drink, and cheap Bread at all times, will make cheap Commodities: And then the poor at <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminſter</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:36927:101"/>need not fear being cruſhed or kept under by ſuch as have great Stocks; for in <hi>England</hi> at this day, in many places, the Richer ſort of Men in the handicraft way, who have great Stocks, do ſo order their affairs, that it's impoſſible for a poor Man to raiſe or advance his fortunes, or get any thing to leave his Wife at his deceaſe, or Portions for his Children; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that hath the great Stock, buys all his materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als at the beſt hand, and is able to keep his Goods for the beſt Market; but the poor Man is forced many times to buy his Materials he makes his Commodity with, of ſome of his own Trade, and is thereby forced to buy dear, and ſell cheap; and certainly that way muſt make them poor, and very poor.</p>
               <p>I have heard ſeveral times many of theſe great Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Handicraft-way, wiſh that ſome-body or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would take their Poor off their Hands, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bemoan the ſad condition they were in; I have enquired into thoſe mens eſtates, and I have often found, that they were Merchants as well as Mechanicks, ſome of them buying Silks at the beſt hand, and ſelling it to the poor Weavers; others buy Wire, and then ſell it to the poor of their own Trades to make Pins, and afterwards take off the Commodity when Manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and give them part Commodities unwrought, and part Moneys; by which way, the poor Handicraft Man is forc'd to let part of that which is gained in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, go to one of his own Trade; and the cauſe of all this, is want of preſent Money or Credit, with cheap Bread and Drink: But I have heard of the other hand, great complaints by the labouring Mechanick, that the great Dealers of their own Trades did undo
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:36927:102"/>them. I will believe both parties, and take all for truth that is ſaid of both hands; but ſeeing the great Maſters of the Mechanick Trades, deſire their Poor may be off their hands, I am reſolved to take them at their words.</p>
               <p>And now all you poor Men in <hi>England,</hi> that work or labour in Mechanick Arts, you are mine: I know now I ſhall have many queſtions asked me, and amongſt the reſt, What will you do with all theſe poor People which you ſay ſhall be yours? My anſwer is, I will make them all rich and happy, and their Families alſo.</p>
               <p>I will now begin to ſhew them the way; but when they are Reading my Project, as moſt will call it, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to act like Soldiers, and command Silence; Suffer not your Wives to uſe any Twit-twat, nor ask queſtions by the way; but Read it over and over again, and then lay all your Heads together, Wife, Children, and Servants, and it's poſſible the younger Fry may live to ſee it Crown'd with a beautiful Blazing-head, as the Monument near <hi>London-Bridg</hi> is with the Urn.</p>
               <p>Now my Children: for ſo I muſt call you, for I now will take care for you all (I will begin): Art thou for Revenge? I know thou art; for thou knoweſt where thy Shoo hath pinch'd thee long: Well, in this caſe, I think Revenge is lawful, becauſe I know what thou wilt be at; but I ask thee this queſtion, What is the Revenge that will beſt fit thy temper, and by thee is moſt deſired? Sir, I deſire to be revenged of ſome of the great Men of our Trade; but it is no further, than I may have ſome part of the benefit of the Trade as well as they; for it is not fit that ſome ſhould have ſo much, and others ſo little, for it is we poor Men that have
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:36927:102"/>moſt Fingers. My Child, thou ſhalt have thy deſire, if it be not thy own fault; I know you and ſuch as you, with your Families, are the Perſons that work, labour, and toyl to make others Rich: Now let me intreat thee to do the ſame for thy ſelf, as thou didſt for others; then believe me the work is done.</p>
               <p>Now Child, I charge thee be a good Husband, for without that, all will be in vain; and that being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by thee, here will be thy condition; when thou comeſt to have in thy poſſeſſion Twenty pounds, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from thy Friends, or by thy own labour, then lay it into the Bank-Granary, ſome for Wheat, ſome for Malt; admit thou waſt now to begin, for thy Twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds thou ſhalt have Six-ſcore Buſhels of Wheat, and Three-ſcore Buſhels of Malt: This Corn and Malt ſhall ſerve thee Three years, being Seven in Family, thy Self, Wife, a Man, a Maid, and Three Children. Now my dear Child, here is Bread and Drink ſufficient, and that is a comfort; and thy ſelf, Wife, Servants, and Children, at perfect liberty to follow your ſeveral and reſpective imploys; and certainly thou art a very bad Husband, if thou doſt not on a ſudden advance thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and get Moneys in Bank-Corn; becauſe thou haſt nothing to pay for Bread and Drink: But here lies a great objection to be anſwered, VVhat ſhall I do for Moneys to buy ſome Materials to ſet our fingers at work (for now all is in Malt and Corn)? I anſwer, thou maiſt at any time take up Ten or Twelve pounds, or more, upon a Mortgage of thy Bank-Corn, to buy Materials to work into Manufacture. Child, I charge thee tell this to thy VVife in Bed, and it may be ſhe underſtanding the benefit that will be to her, and her
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:36927:103"/>Children by this way, ſhe may turn <hi>Dutch</hi>-VVoman, and endeavour to provide ſome Moneys, which ſhe will ſave to buy Corn: And by theſe two ways of having cheap Bread and Drink, and Credit out of the Bank, to take up Moneys at any time when wanting; certainly here thou wilt have ſufficient Revenge of thy former Task-Maſters. Conſider, thy fingers and hands are thy own, and now they are imployed for thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage, and not for others, with cheap Bread and Drink, with Moneys at all times when want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if thou dyeſt, leaving a VVidow behind thee, aſſure thy ſelf, my Daughter need not ſtay long for a Husband; for thou leaving her Bank-Corn, and good ſtore of hands to work, there will be old ſtriving for her, as there is for VVidows that have many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in other parts, where this juſt, delightful, profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſaving, and honourable way is practiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou wilt unavoidably ruine Pawn-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and it is high time, or elſe they will by their great Intereſt ruine all the Poor; and to me it is no leſs then a Miracle, that the Pawn-Brokers had not long ſince ruin'd all the poor People in and about <hi>London,</hi> by high Intereſt, Marſhals-VVrits, Impriſonments, and the dreadful effects now practiſed. Now Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if you will pawn your Clothes, and take them out on <hi>Saturday</hi> Nights, and carry them in on <hi>Monday</hi>-Mornings, or pay Thirty or Fourty in the Hundred for your Moneys, I ſhall take no pity of you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou wilt have no occaſion for a Lawyer, but mayeſt follow thy buſineſs quietly if thou wilt, and be in a condition to augment the number of thy Hands, and ſo increaſe thy Eſtate, and be able to ſet at work the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:36927:103"/>idle Poor which now Beg and Steal; then thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours will love thee for taking their Poor off them, and thou wilt increaſe in Riches, and at laſt it will be <hi>Strive as ſtrive can,</hi> who ſhall have the Poor, even as now they ſtrive at the Seſſions-houſe for Perſons to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> or <hi>Virginia.</hi>—But my Child, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is thy Corn and Malt in Granary, and the Credit which that Corn and Malt gives thee, which is the cauſe of all this.</p>
               <p>I will now leave this ſubject, only I muſt lay a charge upon all my Daughters, whoſe Husbands work in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Arts, That they force their Husbands to eat good Wheaten-Bread, made of Corn that is taken out of the Bank-Granary; and alſo that they force them to drink good Ale and Beer, that is made of Malt taken out of the Bank-Granaries: But I know many will ſay, Here is a new way which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before, to prevent poverty, and the increaſe of beggary. No Friend, it is not ſo, there is a great City beyond the VVater, in the Civil-VVars was much deſtroyed, where this Rule, Order, and Government is now practiſed; and it was high time for that place to fall on this way, for the VVars had wholly beggar'd them: Neceſſity many times brings good things to paſs; I pray God this may be the time with us. Neceſſities force hard, and decay in Trade comes poſting on. I muſt now mind all my Children, who labour in the Mechanick Art, who are reſolved to have Corn for Bank-Credit, of a Story, being a worthy Mans obſervation in <hi>Holland,</hi> which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:36927:104"/>the Bank at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſends to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who lent them Moneys,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> William Temple.</note> to come and fetch their Moneys lent, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, they come with Tears in their Eyes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them to continue it longer: If this Bank-Credit by Corn Granaries were here well fixt, the very like would be with the Mechanicks who have Corn in Bank, there being no Security at preſent to be had, comparable to what this would be.</p>
               <p>I muſt deſire my Children, or ſome of them which can well ſpare Moneys, to buy a Book of Trade, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet out by a worthy Gentleman, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will perfectly ſee,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Roger Cook.</note> That all Trades muſt, and will flouriſh, according as the means is uſed in promoting them; and that Rule, Order, and Policies in Trade, by Sea and Land, Eaſe, Cheapneſs, with conveniences for Trade, have been the means of ſetting up the <hi>Dutch</hi> to this great growth and ſtrength they are now at: And in Reading that Book, you will perfectly ſee, as in a Glaſs, your own condition as now it is; as alſo what it would be, if the thing I treat upon were here well fixt by a good Law.</p>
               <p>Now I will take a ſtep to <hi>Worcester,</hi> and Diſcourſe the poor Clothiers there; but I know they are all of one Lip, a bad Trade, and they do not know when it will mend, neither do they know which way it may be mended; well, becauſe they are Neighbours, and Countrey-men, I will take in the Clothiers of <hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> vvith the Cap-makers of <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and Stuff-Weavers of <hi>Kidderminſter;</hi> and as they are Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in one County, and deal all in the VVool, ſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:36927:104"/>I will fix them all together in One Granary at New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> near <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon:</hi> And for that they ſhall have equal benefit in all things relating to the ſaid Granary, I have here drawn the form of the Bill to be preſented to the Parliament, for the building and ordering the Bank-Granary, and the Corn at New-<hi>Brunſwick</hi> which ſhall be put therein, with all perſons thereunto related.</p>
               <p>BE it enacted by the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty, by and with the conſent of the Lords ſpiritual and temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame, That it ſhall and may be lawful to and for the Incorporated-compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Clothiers of the City of <hi>VVorceſter,</hi> and Town of <hi>Kidderminſter,</hi> with the company of Cappers of the Town of <hi>Bewdley</hi> in the ſaid County, to erect and build one or more Granaries at New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> near the Bridg at <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> in the County of <hi>Warwick,</hi> being the Lands of Sir <hi>John Clapton</hi> Knight, to hold and keep Corn of all ſorts, for the uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the ſaid companies of Clothiers and Cappers; and that the ſaid companies may have and take Lands ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make a good and ſufficient High-way for Carts and other Carriages, to come to and from the ſaid Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or Granaries, provided the ſaid companies of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers and Cappers firſt pay, or cauſe to be paid to Sir <hi>John Clapton,</hi> or his Aſſigns for ſo much Land as they ſhall uſe, or have occaſion for, not under Thirty years
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:36927:105"/>purchaſe; and in caſe there ſhall ariſe any difference about the value of the Land ſo to be made uſe of, then it ſhall be in the power of the Mayor of <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon,</hi> and any two of the Aldermen of the ſaid Town, to ſet down and award how much Moneys ſhall be paid for the quantity of Land to be made uſe of; and ſuch order being made, Signed, and Sealed, by the ſaid Mayor and Aldermen, ſhall bind all Parties concerned, and their Heirs.</p>
               <p>And be it further enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That all Corn and parcels of Corn in Granary, ſhall be affixed, and writ in a plain Table, and in the ſaid Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hung up to be viewed by any that deſire to ſee the ſame; and that all ſuch Corn when in Granary, may be transferred by the party owning the ſame, with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the ſaid Granary, being fairly entred into a Book to be kept for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And be it further enacted, that no Sale, Mortgage, or any other Act ſhall be good for any Corn brought into Bank-Granary, unleſs entred with the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter.</p>
               <p>And be it further enacted, That all Corn or Malt laid up in the ſaid Granary, or Granaries at New-<hi>Brunſwick,</hi> which is the proper Corn of the ſaid companies, may paſs down the River of <hi>Avon,</hi> into the River of <hi>Seavern,</hi> through all Locks, Sluces, Wears, or Turn-picks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying any Tax or Tunage for the ſame, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they the ſaid companies of Cothiers and Cappers firſt get Licenſe under the Hands and Seals of the Right Honourable <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Windſor,

               <p>Now my Loving Countrymen I muſt leave you, and at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> when you have time to Chat by the Fire with your Wives, then let <hi>Nic. Baker</hi> at <hi>Worceſter, Sim. Wood</hi> at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and <hi>Ned Momford</hi> at <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> be your Oracles, and diſcourſe of this Affair of Corn in Granary. And in the mean time I will fetch a March up <hi>Avon</hi> and ſo up <hi>Stower</hi> to <hi>Shopſon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and ſo down the <hi>Sharwel</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and ſo down <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and I will ſee whether <hi>Thames</hi> River may be ſo perfected as Trade by a Water Carriage may be made Communicable and Eaſy, and I will Do my utmoſt endeavour to find out ſome convenient place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sharwel</hi> to build Granaries.</p>
               <p>But I muſt Beg leave, in the firſt place, that I may give ſome Reaſons, which have occaſioned the Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Trade in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and when I have done with them, then I will apply the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes that lye in my knowledge, how the Trade may be recovered into the City again, whereby it will clearly appear, that Trade will be forc't to come and take her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad in the City of <hi>London</hi> as formerly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon, In the Building the City of <hi>London,</hi> there were two great Errors committed, one was of Omiſſion, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Commiſſion; That of Commiſſion is, The Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being made ſo great, thereby the Rents were very High, (at firſt) and when a Tradeſman had paid his Fine, fixt his Counters and Preſſes, and furniſhed his houſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:36927:106"/>as his Wife pleaſed to have it, or as he thought fit to have it furniſhed to get a Wife, that great Charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt Contracted, did ſo leſſen the Tradeſmans Stock, that many were forc't to go into the Suburbs, and ſome into the Countries. The thing of Omiſſion, was the Neglect of putting Houſes to be new built under a Regiſter, when the Act paſt for Building the City, the Credit of which if done, would have been better than Ready Moneys; for by vertue of ſuch undeniable Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as Regiſtred Houſes, Banks (yea many juſt Banks) and Lumber Houſes would have ſprang up, which had ſo enliven'd Trade, and preſerved the Poor out of the hands of the Uſurers, and pawn-Brokers, that the City would have been like a Bee Hive, all would have crept in as long as there was any room, and when no more room, then they would have ſwarm'd abroad.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Reaſon is, The very great Charge which ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies put their Members to in the City of <hi>London</hi> proves many times the ruine of ſome poor Tradeſmen.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The ſevere cuſtoms and practices that ſome of the greateſt Traders in the Mechanick Arts, uſe unto ſome of their own Trade, by ſcruing and pinching them in ſuch things they ſell them in their neceſſity. But I will ſay no more of that, here being Relief to be had in that caſe, for all the poor that work in the Mechanick way, if it be not their faults.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. There is no care taken for the amendment of the River <hi>Lee,</hi> which runs from <hi>Ware</hi> to <hi>Bow,</hi> in all dry times much out of order, nor any notice or regard taken of the great defects that are in the Navigation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River <hi>Thames,</hi> from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> which River would be the beſt Servant the City hath, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated as it ought to be. If I were a Doctor, and could
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:36927:106"/>read a Lecture of the Circulation of the Blood, I ſhould by that awaken all the City: For <hi>London</hi> is as the Heart is in the Body, and the great Rivers are as its Veins; let them be ſtopt, there will then be great danger either of death, or elſe ſuch Veins will apply themſelves to feed ſome other part of the Body, which it was not properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for: For I tell you, Trade will creep and ſteal away from any place, provided ſhe may be better treated elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Conſider the two great Rivers of <hi>England (viz.) Severne</hi> and <hi>Thames,</hi> they muſt be the occaſion of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the benefit of Trade to <hi>London;</hi> but as things now are with theſe Rivers, under their ſeveral defects and imperfections in their Navigations, theſe Rivers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter very little benefit to <hi>London,</hi> or the Trade therein.</p>
               <p>My whole Deſign at this time, and in this Sheet, is to relieve the honeſt poor laborious Handicraft Tradeſman in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and thereby invite Trade into the City again, and alſo line out the way how it may be done, whereby it ſhall evidently appear, to be his own fault, if he be not rich and happy, and his Wife and Children after his Deceaſe be left in a comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, with the great Advantages it will adminiſter to ſuch as ſhall be their Apprentices and Servants. But all you Handicraftſmen, whoſe Cauſe I here plead, muſt take eſpecial notice of my Maxims: Firſt, Remember Honeſty and Honour is as neceſſary for Trade, as Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is for an Army. Secondly, Remember that Honour and Honeſty bring Riches, Riches bring Strength, and Strength brings Trade. Thirdly, Obſerve and conſider that all manufactured Commodities, made with cheap Materials, cheap Victuals, with Moneys at all times when wanted at eaſie Intereſt, and beneficial Laws, well made
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:36927:107"/>and well applyed to the proper juſt ends of things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactured, will make cheap Commodities, and thereby increaſe the Manufactures to great quantities, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Trade. I have already ſhewed you in five ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars, ſome of the Cauſes which have forc'd Trade out of your City, ſome of them are not within the power either of the Law or your Magiſtrates to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, but ſome are; and theſe which may be done with eaſe, I queſtion not but your Magiſtrates will uſe their endeavours to bring them to paſs. The which are, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the New Buildings in the City of <hi>London</hi> under a Regiſter, and procuring a Law to paſs, to enable the ſeveral Companies of Handicraft Tradeſmen in <hi>London,</hi> hereafter mentioned, to have power to make the River <hi>Sharwell</hi> Navigable from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Banbury,</hi> to build Granaries to hold Corn, with Mills or any other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines to go by Water, to be made uſe of for the good and benefit of the ſeveral Companies, whereby Art will be incouraged, and Trade convenienced. The Names of the Companies are as followeth; and the Copy of the Bill to be carried into Parliament, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame follows after; The Company of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the Company of Pin-Makers, the Company of Turners, the Company of Water-men, the Company of Silk-Throwers, the Company of Felt-Makers, the Company of Pavers, the Company of Cloth-Workers, the Company of Plaſterers, the Company of Joyners, the Company of Embroiderers, the Company of Brick-Layers, the Company of Smiths, the Company of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourers, and the Company of Carpenters.</p>

Therefore be it Enacted by the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty, by and with the conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame, That it ſhall and may be lawful to and for the Incorporated Companies of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Pin-Makers, Turners, Mater-men, Silk Throwers, Felt-Makers, Pavers, Cloth-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Plaſterers, Ioyners, Embroiderers, Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, Smiths, Armourers, and Carpenters, to make the River</hi> Sharwell <hi>Navigable, from the City of</hi> Oxford <hi>to the Town of</hi> Banbury <hi>in the County of</hi> Oxford, <hi>and to build Granaries for holding of Corn, with liberty for making of Mills for grinding thereof, with Licence and leave to ſet up Engines to go by Mater, for the uſe and benefit of the ſeveral Trades mentioned in this Act. And for that it ſhall not be any ways prejudicial to the Owners of any Land which ſhall be Cut, or made uſe of for making the ſaid River Navigable, or building the ſaid Granaries, Hills, or Engines; Therefore be it Enacted, That it ſhall and may be lawful to and for the Lord Keeper, or Lord Chancellor of</hi> England, <hi>to grant a Commiſſion under the Great Seal of</hi> England, <hi>thereby Authoriſing Fifteen of the knowingeſt able Gentlemen of the County of</hi> Oxford, <hi>to be Commiſſioners to ſet down and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, what and how much ſhall be paid for the Lands ſo to be Cut or made uſe of, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to be paid before there is any act or thing

               </p>
               <p>In reading my Book of <hi>England's Improvement by Sea and Land,</hi> you will ſee the Cauſes laid open and plain of the decay of Trade, and Manufactures in <hi>England,</hi> and the Reaſons of the low Rates, the things muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ſold for. I have already ſet and appropriated, the Clothiers of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Weavers of <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> and the Cappers of <hi>Bewdley,</hi> to have the benefit of a Granary near <hi>Stratford</hi> upon <hi>Avon;</hi> Now I am for fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral Companies of <hi>London</hi> who work in the laborious Arts, in Granaries upon the River <hi>Sharwel,</hi> near <hi>Anſlo</hi> Bridge in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> about ſeven Miles from <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Arms of the ſeveral Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are in the Map of Rivers in this Book affixed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may plainly ſee, That if the River <hi>Sharwel</hi> were once made Navigable from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Anſlo</hi> Bridge, and the Granaries built in that place for the ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, then all the Rich Corn Countries toward <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and <hi>Brackley,</hi> would be on the Back-ſide of the Granaries, and would at all times ſupply the Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with good Corn, and at cheap Rates, thoſe Parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only places for good Corn and plentiful in <hi>England,</hi> and the Corn may be ground at Mills to be built cloſe by the Granaries, upon the River <hi>Sharwel</hi> and the Meal and Mault carried down by Water to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and there baked and brewed into Bread and Drink;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:36927:110"/>and the Corn and Mault taken and put into Granary, in times that Corn is cheap, will cauſe the poor Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men never to eat dear Bread or Drink dear Drink, and upon the Credit of his Bank Corn he will be able to take up Moneys at all times, to drive his Trade. And then by vertue of cheap Bread and cheap Drink, with Credit out of Bank, with the advantage he may have of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many hands, both Children and Servants, the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Artificer muſt then of neceſſity (if a good husband) advance his Fortunes: And this way, and this way alone is the true way of bringing the Trade again into the City of <hi>London.</hi> And the Granaries being once well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and Corn therein well fixt, happy is he then that can get the Poor of S. <hi>Gyles</hi> or <hi>Cripplegate</hi> to be by him employed. I will now give you one Inſtance what this way of Corn and Mault in Granary will do, if once well fixt at <hi>Anſlo</hi> Bridge in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> with Mills to grind Corn, and Engines ſet up there to go by Water, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate Trade. Suppoſe I were to make Pins, I know that is the ſmalleſt Manufacture that is now made, and there are many Poor of that Trade, that make hard ſhift to live, I think I could make Pins three pence in the Shilling cheaper than they can now be made in <hi>London,</hi> by the greateſt Dealers in that Trade, and all done by the Poor People that are now chargeable to the Pariſh. The manner and way of making the Pins ſo cheap, is or may be very obvious, if People are not ignorantly blind. Firſt, the Wyer muſt be bought at the beſt hand, and ſent to <hi>Anſlo</hi> Bridge, and there drawn and made ſizeable and fit to make all ſorts of Pins; and this to be done by the force and power of a Water Wheel, which will draw more Wire in one day, than ſix men can by the way uſed by arm labour in the ſame time. Secondly, Theſe Poor to make Pins muſt be fixt and ſettled near the Granaries at <hi>Anſlo Bridge,</hi> there to work by good Rules and ſtrict Orders.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:36927:111"/>Thirdly, There they muſt have a publick Brew-houſe and Bake houſe, then all Bread and Drink will be made very cheap; and when the Pins are made, they are in the heart of <hi>England,</hi> and may be ſent down the River <hi>Avon</hi> into <hi>Severne,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Briſtol, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Weſtchester;</hi> and in the way of barter, the Pin-Makers may have Cheeſe from <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and Bacon from <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> for Pins; and the Cheeſe and Bacon may be brought down the River <hi>Severne,</hi> and up the River <hi>Avon,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Anſlo Bridge</hi> by Land, to feed the Pin-Makers. And all this will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at far eaſier and much cheaper Rates than Cheeſe and Bacon are ſold for at <hi>London.</hi> Now if Bread and Drink may always be had at half the Rate at <hi>Anſlo Bridge,</hi> for the Pin-Makers, as they pay at <hi>London</hi> for it, and if the Wyer be drawn cheaper at <hi>Anſlo Bridge</hi> than now it is at <hi>London,</hi> and if good <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Cheeſe and Bacon can be had at <hi>Anſlo Bridge,</hi> at cheaper Rates than at <hi>London,</hi> and Houſe Rent at half the Rate as at <hi>London,</hi> all theſe things being put together will certainly be the means of making Pins three pence in the Shilling cheaper at <hi>Anſlo Bridge,</hi> than now they are, or can be made in <hi>London:</hi> And for hands to work, every Pariſh abounds in Poor; and would willingly be freed of them. But obſerve, if bread and drink were always certain and cheap at <hi>London,</hi> for the benefit of the Mechanick Trades, and well ſettled, to be at all times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Members of the ſeveral Companies, then in <hi>London</hi> could be no Poor, nor want of Trade; for then men would ſtrive who ſhould employ moſt hands, he that employed moſt would get moſt. Suppoſe you were at this time to begin to put your Corn and Mault into Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary at <hi>Anſlo Bridge,</hi> there you may have ſixſcore Buſhels of Wheat, and threeſcore Buſhels of Malt for twenty pounds; and ſuch quantity being laid in will maintain a Family of ſeven Perſons with bread and drink for three years, which is but twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> year for each
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:36927:111"/>Perſon. And as things are managed in <hi>London,</hi> and near <hi>London,</hi> take three years together, one year with another, it is not leſs than three Pounds <hi>per</hi> year that maintains a man in bread and drink. But you will ſay, theſe are good things, but we ſhall never ſee them come to paſs, but (if done) I confeſs it would relieve all the Poor in the City, and increaſe the Trade, and draw Trade into the City again, and would be the great benefit of the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and the Fatherleſs, and prevent the Pawn-brokers from Raking and Screwing the Poor as now they do: Well I will acquaint you, that there are ſome Perſons that have for ſome years laſt paſt foreſeen the Miſery that would unavoidably come upon the Mechanick Trades in the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and there hath been much Pains taken, and ſome Moneys expended by ſurveying the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and the <hi>Sharwell,</hi> to find if they might be ſo made Navigable, and Communicable with the River <hi>Severne</hi> and <hi>Avon,</hi> that thereby a large Trade might be brought to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and all Poor Mechanicks fed with cheap bread and cheap drink; and it is very evident, that if the River <hi>Thames</hi> were perfected, and made compleatly Navigable, as it ought to be, and the <hi>Sharwel</hi> made Navigable, as is preſcribed, only to <hi>Anſlo Bridge,</hi> then the great things here mentioned would come to paſs for the benefit of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to the inlarging of its Trade, and accommodating the perſons working in the Mechanick-Arts; and reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Maſs of Poor that are in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> who now want not only work, but bread al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which is a great reproach, beſides the damage it brings to the Publick. You have here a Copy of the Petition, which is now in my hands to be delivered to the Kings Majeſty, for perfecting the Navigation upon the River <hi>Thames,</hi> as it ought to be done; with the Water mens Grievances, which are many. I having this
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:36927:112"/>Summer ſurveyed the River <hi>Thames</hi> from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and my Son twice, and the River <hi>Sharwel</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, we find the Water-men much abuſed, being forc't to pay ſeveral Taxes, at ſeveral Sluces betwixt <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Burcot,</hi> that part of the River being made Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the 21. of King <hi>James,</hi> and by that Law all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Barges are to paſs and repaſs without Tax. And we find that the great defects in not compleating the ſaid River, with the charge, trouble, and delays occaſioned thereby, is a great hindrance to the Trade of <hi>London,</hi> and many other parts alſo: The Damage whereof to the City of <hi>London,</hi> Bargemen, Country-men, and Trade, is at leaſt fifty thouſand pounds yearly; The particulars how, I will make out, (if deſired or commanded.) And it is a miſery that the Barges ſhould lye on ground a Month or ſix Weeks, as they did this year, and the poor Barge-Maſters ſhould be forc't all that time to maintain ſo many men, as of neceſſity they muſt; beſides, the Tradeſman in <hi>London</hi> wants the Commodity to ſell.</p>
               <p>To the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty, the humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Barge-Maſters Weſtward upon the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and their Servants, humbly ſheweth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat in the one and twentieth Year of the Reign of King</hi> James <hi>of bleſſed Memory, there was an Act of Parliament paſs'd, upon the humble Petition and deſire of the City and Univerſity of</hi> Oxford, <hi>for making the River of</hi> Thames <hi>Navigable, from the ſaid City to</hi> Burcott, <hi>and for maintaining the ſame at the charge of the ſaid City and Univerſity; and by the ſaid Act liberty is given, for Barge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Water-men to bring Barges and Boats up the ſaid River, to carry and recarry all manner of Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſes, for the good of the City of</hi> Oxford, <hi>and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; And of late years the Right Honourable</hi> Thomas <hi>Lord</hi> Windſor, <hi>and others, have made Navigable the River of</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:36927:112"/>Avon, <hi>in the Counties of</hi> Worceſter, Glouceſter, <hi>and</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, <hi>and are about making ſome other Rivers Navigable, which when finiſhed will tend much to the benefit of Trade between</hi> Cheſhire, Shropſhire, Herefordſhire, Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Glouceſterſhire, Staffordſhire, Warwickſhire, Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Briſtol, <hi>and moſt part of</hi> Wales <hi>to</hi> London, <hi>by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commodities down the River</hi> Severne, <hi>and ſo up the River</hi> Avon, <hi>and from thence to</hi> Oxford <hi>by Land, and ſo to</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>by Water, whereby the High-ways and Bridges will be preſerved, and the Goods carried and recarried at two thirds of what they now pay by Land, which will be of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Trade. But may it pleaſe your Majeſty, ſo it is, that the River</hi> Thames <hi>is not as yet made perfectly Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it ought to be, and as it was intended by the Act of Parliament, whereby the City of</hi> Oxford, <hi>and the reſt of your Majeſties Subjects and Barge-men are deprived of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit intended them by the ſaid Navigation, and many times the Barges lye on ground three Weeks or a Month together for want of water, which might be prevented by making three Holds for water in the River</hi> Sharwell <hi>near</hi> Oxford, <hi>to be let down as fluſhes in dry times, as alſo one Lock to be made at</hi> Swift Ditch, <hi>one pair of Gates at</hi> Sutton, <hi>one Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike a Mile below</hi> Sutton, <hi>with two Fluſhes to be taken out of the River</hi> Kennet, <hi>with two places to be made for Fluſhes, one near</hi> Windſor, <hi>the other near</hi> Cherſey, <hi>all which being done, will ſo plentifully ſupply the River with water, that not only the Barges coming from</hi> Oxford <hi>and</hi> Abington, <hi>but many other places, will have the benefit thereof, and bring them clear to</hi> London <hi>without ſtay. The Premiſſes conſidered, your Petitioners moſt humbly pray, that your Majeſhy will be graciouſly pleaſed to appoint Mr.</hi> Robert Yarranton, <hi>a perſon able in that Affair, to ſurvey the defects of the ſaid Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and to make Report thereof from time to time, to the Commiſſioners appointed for the ſame: And that your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty will be graciouſly pleaſed to ſignify unto the ſaid Commiſſioners
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:36927:113"/>your pleaſure, that ſo good a Work may be forthwith perfected, according as is directed in the ſaid Act; and that your Majeſties Subjects and Barge-men may have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of paſſing and repaſſing with their Goods and Barges up and down the ſaid River from</hi> Oxford <hi>to</hi> Burcott, <hi>without paying any Tax or Impoſition for the ſame, unleſs by Law due; and that Orders and Rules may be made by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, for the good and well Governing both of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, Millers, and Bargemen, as is by the Act directed: And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, ſhall daily Pray, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the River <hi>Thames</hi> is perfectly made Navigable to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as it ought to be, then to make the River <hi>Sharwell</hi> Navigable unto <hi>Anſlo Bridge,</hi> will coſt about 2500 <hi>l.</hi> the building of four Granaries, each Granary to hold fourteen thouſand Quarters of Corn, ſix thouſand pounds (all Materials being very dear in that place) for building of Mills, and ſome Wheels to draw Wire, and for other uſe 500 <hi>l.</hi> for building of twenty Houſes for habitation for perſons employed about the Trade and in the Granaries 2000 <hi>l.</hi> all which is ten thouſand pounds, which is but one Shilling a piece from each man of the ſeveral Companies, the Number thereof being two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand perſons, as they themſelves ſay. If theſe Granaries were fixt, ſome other Companies may go up the little River to <hi>Whitney</hi> and build Granaries there; and ſome may go up the <hi>Thames</hi> as far as <hi>Ratcot-bridge,</hi> and build Granaries there; and ſo the good Corn growing in the heart of <hi>England</hi> would be applyed to <hi>London,</hi> which will ſo convenience the people working in the ſeveral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, that the Trade will wholly return to the City again; for hands being maintained at work with cheap Victuals, will make cheap Commodities, and cheap Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities will enlarge Trade. I intend to write one Sheet, more particularly ſetting forth the way of bringing the Trade to <hi>London</hi> again, and feeding the Poor with cheap
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:36927:113"/>bread and drink; which you ſhall have printed on the one ſide of a Sheet of Royal Paper, and on the other ſide a Map of the Rivers which will be ſerviceable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, with the places convenient and fit to build Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with the Arms of the ſeveral Companies in the ſaid Map. One of each Map being ſet in a Frame is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſent to each Hall in <hi>London,</hi> there to receive the opinions of ſuch as the benefit of Granaries is intended for. <hi>In the multitude of Councellors there is ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I muſt make a ſtep to <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> and endeavour to find out how the River <hi>Dee</hi> may be made ſo Navigable to <hi>Bangor-bridge,</hi> that thereby it may be made commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable with the River <hi>Severne.</hi> In the Month of <hi>July</hi> 1674. I was prevailed with by a Perſon of Honour to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the River <hi>Dee,</hi> running by the City of <hi>Cheſter</hi> into the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, and finding the River choked with the Sands that a Veſſel of twenty Tuns could not come to that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble City, and the Ships forc'd to lye at <hi>Neaſon,</hi> in a very bad Harbour, whereby the Ships receive much damage, and Trade made ſo uncertain and chargeable, that the Trade of <hi>Cheſter</hi> is much decayed, and gone to <hi>Leverpool;</hi> and that old great City in danger of being ruin'd, if the River <hi>Dee</hi> be not made Navigable by Act of Parliament, and Ships brought to the City. I have formerly drawn a Map of the New River to be made to bring up the Ships to the City ſide, which Map was preſented to the Duke of <hi>York</hi> by the Lord <hi>Windſor,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Warden,</hi> and therein the Reaſons are inſerted, how it may be done, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it will be to Trade, and the City alſo. The Map is now at <hi>Cheſter</hi> in the keeping of the Mayor. His Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was pleaſed to promiſe the recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to the Parliament, for the making it Navigable. And if it were made to <hi>Cheſter</hi> Navigable by a new Cut, as is in the Map preſcribed, there would be three thouſand Acres of Land gained out of the Sea, and made rich land,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:36927:114"/>beſides the Coles from <hi>Aſton</hi> will be brought to the City of <hi>Cheſter</hi> by Water, which now are brought by land, and all Goods and other things carried and recarried from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> with much leſs charge than now it is. And <hi>Dee</hi> being made Navigable to <hi>Bangor-bridge,</hi> will be a means to make the River <hi>Severne</hi> helpful to convey all Goods to <hi>London,</hi> by ſending it down the River <hi>Severne,</hi> and up the River <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi> and ſo down the <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> whereby much moneys will be ſaved, and Trade advanced. The River <hi>Dee</hi> muſt be taken up with a very ſtrong Wear, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Water Gate of the City of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and ſo the River <hi>Dee</hi> muſt be carried in a large Cut or Trench through the lands below Alderman <hi>Wrights</hi> Houſe, along the Sands, as far as <hi>Flint Caſtle,</hi> and then dropt by a large Cut, into the Deep Water below the Brewhouſe. There muſt alſo be a Cut drawn along the <hi>welch</hi> ſhore, and ſo from <hi>Aſton</hi> Pits, and dropt into the Main Trench, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the waſte water, that comes from the Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains will be voided, and the Coles that are now carried by Land to <hi>Cheſter</hi> will then be carried by water, and at leaſt 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <hi>per Ann.</hi> ſaved in Carriage; This Trench muſt be very large, that two Ships may Sail one by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Sea Banks muſt be made very Firm and Strong, not upright, but very much ſloaping. There muſt alſo be made five very ſtrong Locks or Sluces of Stone, which is there very neceſſary, at the end of the Trench. This will be done for 15000 <hi>l.</hi> The River <hi>Dee</hi> being let down upon a ſudden through the great Trench, will cauſe the Sands to fly and deepen the Channel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make the Harbour ſafe, and help to open and deepen the Bar. But it muſt be done when the Tyde is going out, and when the Wind bloweth hard at Eaſt, with a ſtrong freſh of Water coming off the Mountains. The Map diſcovering the whole Deſign is hereunto Affixed.</p>

               <p>REader, I beg thy pardon, if I have kept thee long in reading this Diſcourſe; but I hope thou wilt not be angry: for when I put Pen to Paper, I intended to be brief. I know there are many, before they have well weighed the Contents of this Book, will think that it may much ſhake their Intereſts, and ſo will be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after the Compiler, and of his Education: And how it is poſſible that one man ſhould know all that is in this Book aſſerted; and will ſay theſe are notions of a hot Brain. I know others, whoſe Sores are great, and Wounds dangerous, and deſire a cure thereby to live at peace (both in their Eſtates and Perſons) will be apt to aſcribe more to the Compiler than is due. For in this Age moſt of the preſent humours are to detract, and abuſe, where Intereſt is pinched or laid open to the World; and on the other hand too much to cry up and extol thoſe that expect benefit and relief. As to both ſorts of Inquiſitors, I will ſave them a labour, and give them a ſhort Account of my Education and Improvement. I was an Apprentice to a Linnen Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per when this King was born, and continued at the Trade ſome years: But the Shop being too narrow and ſhort for my large mind, I took leave of my Maſter, but ſaid nothing. Then I lived a Countrey-life for ſome years, and in the late Wars I was a Soldier, and ſometimes had the Honour and Misfortune to lodg and diſlodg an Army: In the year One thouſand Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fifty two, I entred upon Iron-works, and pli'd them ſeveral years, and in them times I made it my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:36927:118"/>to ſurvey the three great Rivers of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome ſmall ones; and made two Navigable, and a third almoſt compleated. I next ſtudied the great weakneſs of the Rye-lands, and the Surfeit it was then under by reaſon of their long Tillage. I did by Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick and Theorick find out the reaſon of its defection, as alſo of its recovery, and applyed the remedy, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out Two Books which were ſo fitted to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-mans capacity, that he fell on Pell-Mell; and I hope, and partly know, that great part of <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Gloceſterſhire, Herefordſhire, Shropſhire,</hi> and <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> have doubled the value of the Land, by the Husbandry diſcovered to them: See my Two Books Printed by Mr. <hi>Sawbridg</hi> on <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> Entituled, <hi>Yarranton's Improvement by Clover,</hi> and there thou maiſt be further ſatisfied. I alſo for many years ſerved the Countreys with the Seed, and at laſt gave them the knowledg of getting it with eaſe and ſmall trouble; and what I have been doing ſince, my Book tells you at large: And as to any that are my enemies upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Subject, or of ſuch as ſpeak, or aſſert my pains to be to them acceptable, both parties are to me a-like; I only wiſh, and pray, that what is here treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, may by the Powers above us, be ſeriouſly conſidered of; and if it be found it tends to the benefit of this preſent Age, and for the good of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come, then let them purſue the ends to bring it to paſs. If any Gentleman, or other, pleaſe to put Pen to Paper, in oppoſition to what is here aſſerted; I ſhall give him a Civil return, bound up with the Second part: where theſe Seven Heads ſhall be Treated on:</p>
